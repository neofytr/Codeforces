# Power Products Problem Analysis and Documentation

This document analyzes the C++ code provided, offering a detailed breakdown of the problem, solution approach, algorithmic techniques, complexity analysis, and other relevant aspects.

## 1. Problem Description (Inferred)

The problem, found at [https://codeforces.com/contest/1225/problem/D](https://codeforces.com/contest/1225/problem/D), is named "powerProducts". Given an array `arr` of `n` integers and an integer `k`, the goal is to find the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `arr[i] * arr[j]` is a perfect k-th power.

## 2. Approach Explanation

The solution uses the following approach:

1. **Prime Factorization:** It iterates through each number in the input array `arr`. For each number, it performs prime factorization.

2. **Exponentiation modulo k:** For each prime factor, it calculates the exponent. If the exponent is not a multiple of `k`, it reduces the exponent modulo `k`. The resulting exponents represent the essential information about the original number with respect to being a perfect k-th power.

3. **Signature Generation:** After prime factorization, a signature of the number is constructed using the prime factors and their exponents modulo `k`. The signature is represented as a vector of `pair<prime, exponent>`. This signature represents the "excess" needed to become a k-th power.

4. **Complement Calculation:** A complementary signature is calculated. This represents what must be multiplied by the original number to obtain a k-th power. If a prime `p` has exponent `r` in the original number, it will have exponent `(k-r) % k` in its complement.

5. **Frequency Tracking:** A map `freq` stores the frequency of each signature encountered so far.

6. **Counting Pairs:** For each number, the algorithm calculates its complementary signature. It checks if this complementary signature exists in the `freq` map. If it does, it adds the frequency of the complementary signature to the `ans` (the number of pairs).

7. **Incrementing Frequency:**  The frequency of the original number's signature is incremented in the `freq` map.

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Prime Factorization:** The code efficiently computes the prime factorization using the smallest prime factor (SPF) array. The SPF for each number is calculated using a sieve-like approach.
*   **Modular Arithmetic:** Using the modulo operator `%` to reduce the exponents modulo `k` is crucial. This allows determining the "remainder" of the prime factors' powers with respect to a perfect k-th power.
*   **Signatures:**  Creating signatures of the numbers allows efficient comparison and identification of numbers that, when multiplied together, form a perfect k-th power.
*   **Complementary Signatures:** The idea of calculating complementary signatures is the core of the solution. It directly addresses the problem of finding pairs whose product is a k-th power. The complementary signature represents the "missing factors" required to make the original number a perfect k-th power.
*   **Hashing (using `map`):**  Using a `map` (or a hash table in general) to store the frequencies of the signatures is a key optimization.  It enables efficient counting of the pairs that satisfy the condition. `map` uses a balanced tree behind the scenes so lookups are `O(log n)`, where `n` is the size of the `map`. `unordered_map` could have been used instead for an expected `O(1)` lookup time.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:**

    *   **SPF Calculation:** `O(MAX * log(log(MAX)))`, which is approximately `O(MAX)` in practice, where `MAX = 100000`.
    *   **Outer Loop (Iterating through `arr`):** `O(n)`
    *   **Prime Factorization inside the loop:** In the worst case, prime factorization can take `O(sqrt(val))` where `val` is the input array value. Since the SPF is precomputed, this is more precisely `O(log(val))`.
    *   **Signature and Complement Calculation:** In the worst case, this takes time proportional to the number of distinct prime factors which is at most `O(log(val))`.
    *   **`map` operations:** Assuming a `map` implementation using balanced trees, each lookup (`freq.count(comp)`) and insertion (`freq[sig]++`) has a time complexity of `O(log(m))`, where `m` is the number of distinct signatures.  In the worst case `m = n`.

    Therefore, the overall time complexity is approximately `O(MAX + n * log(max(arr[i])) * log(n))`.

*   **Space Complexity:**

    *   `spf` vector: `O(MAX)`
    *   `arr` vector: `O(n)`
    *   `freq` map: `O(m)`, where `m` is the number of distinct signatures.  In the worst case, this could be `O(n)`.
    *   The `exp`, `sig`, and `comp` vectors within the loop use at most O(number of distinct prime factors of `arr[i]`) which is `O(log(arr[i]))`.

    The overall space complexity is dominated by `O(MAX + n)`.

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **Precomputed SPF:** The use of a precomputed smallest prime factor (SPF) array significantly speeds up the prime factorization process. This technique is commonly used when multiple prime factorizations are required.
*   **Clarity using `map`:** Using the `map<vector<pair<int,int>>, int> freq` provides a clear and convenient way to hash the signatures for efficient counting, although it could be further optimized with an `unordered_map` and a custom hashing function.
*   **Using `int long long`:** Using `long long` for integers is important in many competitive programming problems to avoid integer overflow. The `#define int long long` preprocessor directive is a common way to ensure all integers are treated as `long long`.

## 6. Edge Cases Handled

The code implicitly handles the following edge cases:

*   **k = 1:** If `k = 1`, any pair of numbers will result in a perfect k-th power. The modulo operation in this case effectively removes all exponents, and the solution will find all possible pairs.
*   **Zero exponents:** If a number has a prime factor raised to a power that is a multiple of `k`, the exponent will become zero after the modulo operation, effectively removing that prime factor from the signature.
*   **Duplicate numbers:** The `freq` map correctly handles duplicate numbers by incrementing the count of their signatures.

However, the code assumes the input numbers in the array are greater than or equal to 1. Input values of zero could cause issues, but it appears that the problem constraints prevent this from occurring.  It should also be noted that if very large prime numbers were present in the input, calculating the SPF array up to `MAX` would be insufficient, and the solution would need to be modified.
