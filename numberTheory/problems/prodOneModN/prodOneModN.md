## Problem: Product of Numbers Congruent to 1 Modulo N

This solution addresses the Codeforces problem [prodOneModN](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1514/C).  The problem asks us to find a maximal subset of the numbers from 1 to `n-1` such that each element in the subset is coprime with `n`, and the product of the elements in the subset is congruent to 1 modulo `n`. The task is to output the size of this subset and its elements.

## Approach Explanation

The core idea revolves around finding all numbers `r` within the range `1 <= r < n` that are coprime to `n` (i.e., `gcd(r, n) == 1`). The solution first computes this set of numbers and stores them in the `f` vector.

Then, the product of all these numbers modulo `n` is calculated.  Let's call this product `res`.  There are two possibilities:

1. **`res == 1`**: In this case, the set of all coprime numbers is already the desired set, and the solution directly outputs the size of `f` and its elements.

2. **`res != 1`**: Here, the product of all coprime numbers is not congruent to 1 modulo `n`. The crucial observation is that since each number in `f` is coprime to `n`, and `res` is also coprime to `n`, then if we remove `res` from the product, the remaining numbers will have a product that *is* congruent to 1 modulo `n`.  Therefore, the solution removes `res` from the `f` vector and outputs the remaining elements.

## Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

* **Coprime Numbers and GCD:** The fundamental idea is to identify numbers that are coprime to `n`. This involves calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm (`gcd(a, b)`).  The numbers `r` satisfying `gcd(r, n) == 1` are the relevant candidates.

* **Modular Arithmetic:** The product is calculated modulo `n` to prevent integer overflow and to keep the result within the desired range.

* **Modular Multiplicative Inverse (Implicit):** While not explicitly calculated, the removal of `res` when `res != 1` implicitly uses the concept of the modular multiplicative inverse.  Think of it this way: Let `P` be the product of all coprimes.  We want `P' ≡ 1 (mod n)`.  If `P ≡ res (mod n)`, then `P * res_inv ≡ 1 (mod n)`. In our case, `res` is its own inverse because we are removing it from the product, effectively dividing `P` by `res` (in a modular sense).  This works because `res` is also coprime to `n`, so it has a multiplicative inverse.

* **Subset Construction:** The core strategy is to first find the set of *all* candidates and then remove at most one element to satisfy the congruence condition. This is more efficient than trying to build the subset incrementally.

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:**
    * The loop iterating from 1 to `n-1` takes O(n) time.
    * Inside the loop, `gcd(r, n)` takes O(log n) time.
    * Calculating `res` and its modulo takes O(n) time (in the worst case, when all numbers are coprime).
    * Removing `res` and printing takes O(n) time.
    * Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the loop and gcd calculation, resulting in **O(n log n)**.

* **Space Complexity:**
    * The `f` vector can store at most `n-1` elements.
    * `res` is a single integer variable.
    * Overall, the space complexity is **O(n)**.

## Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

* **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`**: This is a common optimization technique in competitive programming to speed up input/output by disabling synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams.

* **`#define int long long`**: This redefines `int` as `long long` to prevent integer overflow issues, especially important given the product calculation. Although the product is performed modulo `n`, `n` can be reasonably large.

## Edge Cases Handled

* **The case where `res == 1`**:  The code explicitly handles this case, where the product of all coprimes is already congruent to 1 modulo `n`.

* **`n == 1`:**  Although it's unlikely to be in the test cases (since the problem specifies a range from 1 to n-1), theoretically if n=1 the loop will not run and f will be empty.  `res` would be initialized to 1 which leads to correct output (empty set of size 0).

In summary, the code effectively leverages the properties of coprime numbers and modular arithmetic to solve the problem in an efficient manner. The implicit use of modular multiplicative inverses through the strategic removal of the 'res' element is a clever technique.
