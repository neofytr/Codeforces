## Documentation of Competitive Programming Solution for GCDEX (SPOJ)

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the given C++ solution for the GCDEX problem on SPOJ (https://www.spoj.com/problems/GCDEX/).

### 1. Problem Description (Inferred)

The GCDEX problem (as can be inferred from the code and the mentioned SPOJ URL) asks us to compute the following sum for a given integer `n`:

```
G(n) = sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{j=i+1}^{n} gcd(i, j)
```

The task is to efficiently compute `G(n)` for multiple values of `n`.

### 2. Approach Explanation

The solution employs a clever approach to efficiently compute `G(n)`.  Instead of directly calculating the GCD for all pairs (i, j), it uses the following strategy:

1. **Euler's Totient Function (Phi Function):**  The code first precomputes Euler's totient function, `phi[i]`, for all `i` from 1 to `MAX` (1,000,000). `phi[i]` represents the number of integers between 1 and `i` that are relatively prime to `i`.

2. **Relating GCD to Phi:** The core idea is to relate the GCD sum to the phi function. Specifically,  `res[n]` is computed as `sum_{d | n} d * phi(n / d)`.  `res[n]` calculates the sum of GCDs where `n` is the larger number, and the GCD equals `d`. `d` must be a divisor of `n`, let `n = k * d`. Then gcd(a, k*d) = d can be expressed as gcd(a/d, k) = 1. This becomes finding how many numbers `a` can fit the criteria where 1 <= a <= n and gcd(a, k) = 1. With k = n/d, there are phi(k) numbers that can satisfy that. And since the gcd(a, k*d) = d, and we want to sum the values of all these gcds together, the total is d * phi(k) or d * phi(n/d).

3. **Summing up the GCDs:** `res[n]` accumulates the sum of GCDs for each value `n`. `res[n]` represents the sum of gcd(i,j) where max(i,j) = n, but it doesn't fulfill the problem's `i < j` requirement.

4. **Prefix Sum:**  The code then calculates the prefix sum of `res[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `MAX`.  `prefix[n]` now represents the sum of `res[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`. The sum from `res[1]` to `res[n]` is `sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{d|i} d * phi(i/d)`. This represents `sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{j=1 to i} gcd(i,j)`, which has redundant values (e.g. gcd(1,2) and gcd(2,1)).

5. **Final Calculation:** Finally, for a given `n`, the solution calculates `prefix[n] - (n * (n + 1)) / 2`.  Here's the breakdown of why this works:
   * `prefix[n]` represents the sum of gcd(i, j) for all 1 <= i, j <= n, where i and j do not need to be distinct.
   * The value `n * (n + 1) / 2` represents `sum_{i=1 to n} i`. This is equal to `sum_{i=1 to n} gcd(i, i)`.
   * Therefore, `prefix[n] - (n * (n + 1)) / 2` represents the sum of all `gcd(i, j)` where i and j are not the same. In other words, `prefix[n] - (n * (n + 1)) / 2 = sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{j=1, j!=i to n} gcd(i,j)`.
   * This is equal to `2 * sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{j=i+1 to n} gcd(i,j)`.
   * We must divide the final value by 2 to solve for the target sum. In this code, the multiplication and division by 2 are eliminated.

### 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

* **Euler's Totient Function:** Efficiently precalculating phi(n) enables fast computation of the core sum.
* **Divisor Iteration:**  The inner loop iterates through divisors of `n`, which is a common technique in number theory problems. This allows efficient calculation of `res[n]`.
* **Prefix Sum:**  Using a prefix sum allows for answering multiple queries in O(1) time (after the initial precomputation).  This is crucial for problems with many test cases.
* **GCD Summation Transformation:**  The critical insight is transforming the direct GCD sum calculation into a form involving Euler's totient function and divisors. This allows for efficient precomputation.
* **Careful Accounting:** Understanding exactly what each intermediate sum (`res`, `prefix`) represents is essential for deriving the correct final formula.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:**
    * Precomputing Phi: O(MAX * log log MAX) using a sieve-like approach (harmonic series).
    * Calculating `res`: O(MAX * log MAX) because the inner loop iterates through divisors. The total number of divisor calculations summed over all `r` up to MAX is roughly MAX * log MAX.
    * Calculating `prefix`: O(MAX)
    * Answering Queries: O(1) per query.
    * Overall Preprocessing: O(MAX * log MAX)
    * Overall Per-Query: O(1)
* **Space Complexity:** O(MAX) due to the `phi`, `res`, and `prefix` arrays.

### 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

* **`#define int long long`:** This is crucial to avoid integer overflow issues, especially when dealing with sums of GCDs. The problem may require sums exceeding the range of a standard 32-bit integer.
* **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:**  This is a standard optimization technique used in competitive programming to speed up input/output by disabling synchronization between C and C++ streams.
* **Sieve-like Phi Calculation:** The method for calculating `phi` is similar to the Sieve of Eratosthenes and is highly efficient.
* **Divisor iteration using j += r:** The inner loop `for (int j = r; j <= MAX; j += r)` efficiently iterates through all multiples (and thus divisors) of `r`.

### 6. Any Edge Cases Handled

* **`n = 0` Termination:** The `while (cin >> n, n)` loop elegantly handles the termination condition where `n` is 0.  This is a typical pattern for problems with multiple test cases where 0 signifies the end of input.
* **Integer Overflow:**  Using `long long` data type avoids integer overflow issues when calculating sums of GCDs, particularly for larger values of n. While not explicitly a conditional check, it is a necessary preventative measure.

In summary, the solution is highly optimized using number theory insights, precomputation, and standard competitive programming techniques. The transformation of the GCD sum into a form involving Euler's totient function is the key to its efficiency.
