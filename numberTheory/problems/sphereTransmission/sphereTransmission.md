## Code Documentation and Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the provided C++ code snippet.  Based on the code, we can infer the problem the code aims to solve.

### 1. Problem Description (Inferred)

The code appears to be solving the following problem:

Given an integer `n`, consider all possible divisors `k` of `n`. For each divisor `k`, calculate `s = k + (n/k) * k * (k-1) / 2 = k * (1 + (n/k) * (k-1) / 2)`.  The goal is to find all distinct `s` values and print them in ascending order.  Furthermore, for each divisor `k`, we need to multiply the count of that divisor by `phi(n/k)`, where `phi` is Euler's totient function. Finally the problem specifically includes a edge case for `k = n` which causes `s = 1` to be included with count 1.

In simpler terms, for each divisor `k` of `n`, we calculate `s` based on a formula related to `k` and `n/k`, and accumulate `phi(n/k)` into a `map` to store `s`'s counts. Ultimately, the code outputs all distinct `s` values obtained.

### 2. Approach Explanation

The core approach can be broken down as follows:

1.  **Divisor Generation:**  The code efficiently generates all divisors of `n` by iterating up to the square root of `n`. If `g` is a divisor, then `n/g` is also a divisor. This avoids iterating through all numbers from 1 to `n`.
2.  **`s` Calculation:** For each divisor `g`, the code calculates `d1 = n / g` and then `s1 = d1 + g * d1 * (d1 - 1) / 2;` this is the core equation that computes the `s` value. Then `phi(d1)` gets added to the count for `s1` in the map. Likewise it calculates `d2 = g` and `s2 = d2 + (n / d2) * d2 * (d2 - 1) / 2;` with `phi(d2)` being added to the count for `s2` in the map.
3.  **Euler's Totient Function (`phi`):** The `phi(n)` function calculates Euler's totient function, which counts the number of integers between 1 and `n` (inclusive) that are coprime to `n`.  It efficiently computes `phi(n)` by iterating through prime factors of `n` and applying the formula:
    `phi(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)` where `p1, p2, ..., pk` are the distinct prime factors of `n`.
4.  **Storing Counts in a Map:** A `map<int, int> mp` is used to store the `s` values as keys and their associated counts (obtained from Euler's totient function) as values.  Using a `map` automatically sorts the `s` values in ascending order.
5.  **Edge Case Handling:** The `mp[1]++;` line handles a special edge case, adding an additional count of 1 to `s=1`. This corresponds to the case where `k=n`.
6.  **Output:** Finally, the code iterates through the `map` and prints all distinct `s` values.

### 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Efficient Divisor Generation:** Iterating up to the square root to find divisors is a crucial optimization technique.  If `g` is a divisor of `n`, then `n/g` is also a divisor. This avoids iterating through all numbers up to `n`.
*   **Euler's Totient Function:** Understanding and efficiently calculating Euler's totient function is essential. The code uses the standard formula based on prime factorization.
*   **Map for Sorting and Counting:** The `map` data structure is used to store and count the occurrences of `s` values.  The `map` automatically sorts the keys (the `s` values), which is required for the final output.
*   **Mathematical Formula:** The `s = k + (n/k) * k * (k-1) / 2` is the core part of the algorithm and its derivation probably comes from some specific problem context that the code is designed for.  Understanding the origin of this formula would require more context from the original problem.
*   **Edge Case Awareness:** The addition `mp[1]++;` highlights the importance of identifying and handling edge cases. Without it, the result would be incomplete.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   Divisor Generation: O(sqrt(n))
    *   `phi(n)`: O(sqrt(n)) in the worst case, where `n` is a prime number (due to iterating potential prime factors). However the inner loop in `main` calls `phi` at most O(sqrt(n)) times. Thus the overall time complexity can be approximated as O(sqrt(n)) * O(sqrt(n)) = O(n) + O(sqrt(n) * log(n)). The `log(n)` term is more of a technicality from the prime factorization in phi and isn't really impacting the result.
    *   Map operations (insertion, iteration): O(log(number of distinct `s` values)) for each operation. However, the maximum size of the `map` is bounded by the number of divisors of `n`, which is typically much smaller than `n`, especially for numbers with many small prime factors. In the worst case, the map could hold O(sqrt(n)) distinct values.  So, the log factor can be roughly considered to be O(log(sqrt(n)) which reduces to O(log(n)/2).
    *   Overall, the dominant factor is the divisor generation and `phi` calculation, resulting in a time complexity of approximately **O(n)**.

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   `map<int, int> mp`: The `map` stores at most the number of divisors of `n`, which is O(sqrt(n)) in the worst case but can be lower in many cases (e.g., `n` is a power of 2).
    *   Other variables: O(1)
    *   Therefore, the overall space complexity is **O(sqrt(n))**.

### 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`#define int long long`:** This is a common practice in competitive programming to prevent integer overflow issues when dealing with large numbers, especially when multiplication is involved.
*   **`ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(nullptr);`:** These lines are used to speed up input/output operations by disabling synchronization between the C and C++ standard input/output streams.
*   **Iterating up to `sqrt(n)` for divisors:** This is an efficient way to generate divisors without iterating through all numbers from 1 to `n`.
*   **Using a `map` to store and sort distinct values:** The `map` data structure provides automatic sorting and efficient lookups, which is useful for collecting distinct values and their frequencies.

### 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   The most explicit edge case handled is the `mp[1]++;`, which correctly handles the case where `k = n`. This ensures that `s = 1` is always included in the output with a count of 1.

### Conclusion

    mp[1]++; // for k = n

    for (auto &[s, cnt] : mp)
