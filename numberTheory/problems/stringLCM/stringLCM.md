## Competitive Programming Solution Documentation

This document analyzes the provided C++ code snippet, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of its functionality, algorithmic techniques, and potential improvements.

### 1. Problem Description

The code solves a string-based problem. Given two strings `s` and `t`, the goal is to find the shortest string that can be formed by repeating `s` and `t` such that the resulting strings are equal. If no such string exists, the program should output `-1`.  In other words, the problem is:

*   **Input:** Two strings `s` and `t`.
*   **Output:**  If there exists a string `x` such that `x` can be formed by repeating `s` and repeating `t`, print the shortest such `x`. Otherwise, print `-1`.

### 2. Approach Explanation

The code implements the following approach:

1.  **Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM):** It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two input strings, `s` and `t`.  The LCM represents the length of the shortest string that could potentially be formed by repeating both `s` and `t`.

2.  **Repeat the strings:**  It repeats string `s` a certain number of times (`len / s.size()`) to create string `S` of length `len`. Similarly, it repeats string `t` (`len / t.size()`) to create string `T` of length `len`.

3.  **Compare the Repeated Strings:**  It then compares `S` and `T`.

4.  **Output:** If `S` and `T` are equal, the code outputs `S` (which is the same as `T`). Otherwise, it outputs `-1`, indicating that no such repeated string exists.

### 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **LCM and String Repetition:** The core idea is that if a common repeated string exists, its length must be a multiple of both `s.size()` and `t.size()`. The LCM gives the smallest such multiple, enabling the search for the *shortest* common repeated string.

*   **String Repetition:** The `repeat` function effectively generates the repeated string, avoiding manual construction via a loop inside the main logic. This improves readability.

*   **Premature Optimization:** The line `result.reserve(s.size() * times);` in the `repeat` function is a micro-optimization to prevent multiple reallocations when constructing the `result` string.  This can slightly improve performance, especially for large strings.

*   **Integer Type Choice:** `#define int long long` is used, presumably to avoid integer overflow issues when calculating the LCM, especially with larger input string lengths. The problem might involve constraints that lead to exceeding the limits of a standard `int`.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   Calculating the LCM involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD), which typically uses the Euclidean algorithm (O(log(min(s.size(), t.size())))).
    *   String repetition in `repeat` function is O(s.size() * times), in the worst case.  Since `times` is bounded by `len / s.size()` and `len` is the LCM, string repetition operations takes O(LCM) time.
    *   String comparison (`S == T`) is O(len), or O(LCM).
    *   The overall time complexity is dominated by calculating the LCM and string construction and comparison, hence it's roughly **O(LCM)**, where LCM is the least common multiple of lengths of the strings s and t.
    *   The `while (q--)` loop executes `q` times, so the overall time complexity is **O(q * LCM)**.

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   The `repeat` function creates a new string `result` of length `len`, so its space complexity is O(len).
    *   The strings `S` and `T` also have a length of `len`, contributing O(len) space.
    *   Therefore, the overall space complexity is **O(LCM)**.

### 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`#define int long long`:** This preprocessor directive is a common trick in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow issues when dealing with large numbers. It changes the default `int` data type to `long long`, which has a larger range.

*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:** This disables synchronization between the C and C++ standard input/output streams and unties `cin` from `cout`, resulting in faster input/output operations.  This is especially crucial when dealing with a large number of input/output operations, as in competitive programming environments.

*   **String `reserve()`:** Pre-allocating string space can improve performance.

### 6. Any Edge Cases Handled

*   **No Common Repeated String:** The code correctly handles the case where no common repeated string exists by outputting `-1`. This happens when the repeated versions of `s` and `t` never become equal, even after reaching the LCM of their lengths.
*   **Potential Integer Overflow:** The `#define int long long` directive is likely included to address potential integer overflow issues during LCM calculation and when calculating repeat factors.  It makes the code more robust when given longer input strings.

## Original Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define int long long

string repeat(const string &s, int times) {
    string result;
    result.reserve(s.size() * times);
    for (int i = 0; i < times; i++)
        result += s;
    return result;
}

int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int q;
    cin >> q;
    while (q--) {
        string s, t;
        cin >> s >> t;

        int len = lcm((int)s.size(), (int)t.size());

        string S = repeat(s, len / s.size());
        string T = repeat(t, len / t.size());

        if (S == T)
            cout << S << "\n";
        else
            cout << -1 << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
