# Documentation for Dividing Sequence Problem

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the provided C++ solution to the "dividingSeq" problem, found on Kattis at [https://open.kattis.com/problems/sequence](https://open.kattis.com/problems/sequence).

## 1. Problem Description (Inferred)

The problem, based on the code and its context, asks to find the longest sequence of integers between 1 and `n` such that each element in the sequence divides the next element.  The output should consist of two lines.  The first line should contain the length of the longest such sequence. The second line should print the sequence itself.

For example:

*   If `n = 10`, a possible solution is `1 2 4 8`, or `1 2 4 10`, or `1 2 6 10` (the length of each sequence is 4).
*   If `n = 5`, a possible solution is `1 2 4`

## 2. Approach Explanation

The solution uses dynamic programming to find the longest dividing sequence.  It maintains two vectors:

*   `lenEnd[i]`: Stores the length of the longest dividing sequence that ends at `i`.
*   `parent[i]`: Stores the predecessor of `i` in the longest dividing sequence that ends at `i`.  This allows for backtracking to reconstruct the sequence.

The core logic iterates through all possible ending points `d` from 1 to `n`.  For each `d`, it iterates through all multiples `m` of `d` that are less than or equal to `n`.  If adding `m` to the sequence ending at `d` results in a longer sequence, `lenEnd[m]` is updated to `lenEnd[d] + 1`, and `parent[m]` is set to `d`.

After the dynamic programming stage, the algorithm finds the element `bestEnd` that has the maximum `lenEnd` value, which signifies the ending point of the longest sequence. It then backtracks from `bestEnd` using the `parent` array to reconstruct the entire sequence.

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Dynamic Programming:** The core idea is to build up the solution iteratively.  `lenEnd[i]` represents the optimal solution (longest sequence ending at `i`) for a smaller subproblem. The algorithm exploits the optimal substructure property where the optimal solution to the overall problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions to subproblems.
*   **Divisibility Condition:** The algorithm explicitly checks for the divisibility condition (i.e., `m` is a multiple of `d`) which is central to the problem.
*   **Backtracking:** The `parent` array enables backtracking to reconstruct the actual sequence after the lengths have been calculated. This is a common technique when solving dynamic programming problems where you need not only the value of the optimal solution but also the path/sequence that leads to that value.
*   **Memoization:** The `lenEnd` vector serves as a memoization table, storing intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** The nested loops dominate the time complexity. The outer loop iterates `n` times. The inner loop iterates through multiples of `d`, which can be at most `n/d` times.  Therefore, the total number of iterations for the inner loop is sum of `n/d` where `d` ranges from 1 to `n`. This can be expressed as `n * (1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n)`, and the sum `1/1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/n` is the nth harmonic number, which is approximately `ln(n) + O(1)`.  So the time complexity is approximately O(n log n).
*   **Space Complexity:** The `lenEnd` and `parent` vectors each store `n + 1` integers. The `seq` vector can, in the worst case, store `n` integers. Thus, the space complexity is O(n).

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`#define int long long`:** This is a common practice in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow issues when dealing with large numbers.  By default, `int` might be a 32-bit integer, which can overflow easily.
*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:**  These lines are used to speed up input/output operations in C++. They disable synchronization between the C and C++ standard input/output streams and un-tie `cin` from `cout`.
*   **`max_element()`:** This function is used to efficiently find the maximum element in a range. In this case, it's used to find the index of the maximum value in the `lenEnd` vector.
*   **Reverse sequence for output:** Since we build the sequence from the end to the beginning, we need to reverse it to obtain the desired output.

## 6. Any Edge Cases Handled

*   The algorithm correctly handles the base case where the sequence can start with 1. Since `lenEnd` is initialized to 1, starting sequence at each index automatically includes the number itself in the sequence.
*   The problem does not explicitly mention an empty sequence as a valid answer, but the code will return a sequence of length 1 if n=1. In general, it implicitly deals with the edge case of an input n=1 which means the longest sequence is just 1, with length 1.
* The code works correctly even when no further division can happen past a point in the sequence. The algorithm would backtrack till the first element in the sequence.

    for (int x : seq) cout << x << " ";
    cout << "\n";

    return 0;
