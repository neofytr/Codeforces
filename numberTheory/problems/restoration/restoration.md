# Problem: Restoration (Codeforces 1409C)

## 1. Problem Description

The problem ([Codeforces 1409C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1409/C)) asks us to find an arithmetic progression of length `n` such that two given elements `x` and `y` are present in the progression.  We are given `n`, `x`, and `y`. We need to find *any* such arithmetic progression and print it. If multiple solutions exist, minimize the maximum value in the progression.

## 2. Approach Explanation

The solution iterates through possible starting values `a` and common differences `d` to find a valid arithmetic progression. The primary goal is to minimize the largest element in the sequence, which dictates the choice of `a` and `d`.

The algorithm works as follows:

1.  **Iterate through potential starting values `a`:** The outer loop iterates through possible values of `a` from 1 up to `x`. This limits the search space reasonably since the problem implies positive integers only are considered.
2.  **Calculate the number of terms between `a` and `y`:**  Given `a` and `y`, the difference `y - a` must be a multiple of `d` if `y` is to be a term in the sequence.
3.  **Iterate through potential common differences `d`:**  For each `a`, the code calculates `y - a`. If `y - a` is positive, it then iterates through the divisors `d` of `y - a`. Crucially, it only needs to iterate up to the square root of `y - a`, as any divisor `d` has a corresponding divisor `(y - a) / d`.
4.  **Check for valid length:** For each divisor `d`, it calculates the number of terms, `len`, needed to reach `y` from `a` with common difference `d`. This is computed as `(y - a) / d + 1`. If `len` is less than or equal to `n`, the sequence is potentially valid.
5.  **Ensure `x` is in the sequence:** We also verify that `x` is also part of that sequence. This is done using `(x - a) % d == 0`.
6.  **Minimize the maximum element:** If `x` is also in the progression, the code calculates the maximum element in the progression using `a + (n - 1) * d`. It then checks if this maximum element is smaller than the current `bestMax` found so far. If it is, it updates `bestMax`, `bestA`, and `bestD`.
7.  **Print the result:** After the loops complete, the code prints the arithmetic progression with the best `a` and `d` values found.

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Divisor Iteration Optimization:**  The code iterates through divisors up to the square root of `y - a`, significantly reducing the number of iterations needed to find all possible common differences.  This is a standard optimization technique for divisor-related problems.
*   **Brute Force with Constraints:** Although the approach iterates through many possible values of `a` and `d`, the constraints `a <= x` and `(y - a) % d == 0` combined with only iterating to the square root of `y-a` ensures the loops run fast enough to pass the time limit.
*   **Finding Valid Arithmetic Progressions:** The core idea is to understand how to ensure both `x` and `y` are part of the arithmetic progression with the given constraints. Ensuring `y - a` is divisible by `d` and `(x-a) % d == 0` are crucial.
*   **Minimization Strategy:** The algorithm focuses on minimizing the *maximum* element of the arithmetic progression by maintaining `bestMax`, `bestA`, and `bestD` and updating them when a better candidate is found.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** The dominant part of the time complexity comes from the nested loops. The outer loop runs up to `x`. The inner loop runs up to the square root of `y - a`, which is roughly `sqrt(y)`. Therefore, the overall time complexity can be approximated as `O(t * x * sqrt(y))`. Since `x` and `y` are given to be at most 50 (from the problem constraints), and `t` is at most 10000, the solution is efficient enough.
*   **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(1)` because the algorithm only uses a fixed number of variables regardless of the input size.

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:** This is a standard optimization technique in C++ competitive programming to speed up input/output operations by disabling synchronization between C and C++ streams and unlinking `cin` and `cout`.
*   **`#define int long long`:**  This macro redefines `int` as `long long`, allowing the program to handle larger integer values and prevent integer overflow issues.
*   **Square Root Divisor Iteration:** Iterating divisors `d` such that `d * d <= num` and checking both `d` and `num / d` is an efficient way to find all divisors of a number.

## 6. Any Edge Cases Handled

*   **`y > a`:** The code explicitly checks that `y` must be larger than `a` by `if (num <= 0) continue;` because the difference needs to be a positive number in order for the common difference to be positive.
*   **`bestMax` Initialization:** `bestMax` is initialized to `LLONG_MAX` to ensure that the first valid sequence will always be considered the "best" initially.
*   **Integer Overflow:** Using `long long` integers helps avoid potential overflow issues when calculating `a + (n - 1) * d`.
*   **Ensuring `x` is in progression:** By checking `(x - a) % d == 0` after checking the length the code ensures that the selected values for `a` and `d` produce a sequence which contains both `x` and `y`.
