# Code Documentation: Counting Divisors

This document provides a detailed analysis of the provided C++ code, which solves the "Counting Divisors" problem on CSES ([https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1713](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1713)).

## 1. Problem Description

The "Counting Divisors" problem asks us to find the number of divisors for a given set of integers.  For each input integer *x*, we need to determine how many numbers between 1 and *x* (inclusive) divide *x* without any remainder.

## 2. Approach Explanation

The code leverages the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely represented as a product of prime numbers, raised to some powers.  Specifically, if *x* = p<sub>1</sub><sup>a<sub>1</sub></sup> * p<sub>2</sub><sup>a<sub>2</sub></sup> * ... * p<sub>n</sub><sup>a<sub>n</sub></sup>, where p<sub>i</sub> are distinct prime numbers and a<sub>i</sub> are positive integers, then the number of divisors of *x* is given by:

(a<sub>1</sub> + 1) * (a<sub>2</sub> + 1) * ... * (a<sub>n</sub> + 1).

The code uses the following steps:

1. **Precomputation (Sieve of Eratosthenes):**  A modified Sieve of Eratosthenes is used to precompute the smallest prime factor for each number up to a certain maximum value (MAX = 1000000).  This is stored in the `prime` vector. `prime[i]` holds the smallest prime divisor of `i`. This allows for efficient prime factorization later.

2. **Input Processing:** The code reads the number of test cases *n* and then iterates through each test case, reading an integer *x*.

3. **Prime Factorization:**  For each input *x*, the code efficiently calculates its prime factorization using the precomputed `prime` vector. Instead of iterating through all possible divisors, it directly uses the `prime[x]` value to extract the smallest prime factor.  The exponent of each prime factor is tracked.

4. **Counting Divisors:** The number of divisors is calculated using the formula described above, based on the exponents obtained during the prime factorization.

5. **Output:** The code prints the calculated number of divisors for each input integer *x*.

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:**  The entire solution hinges on the principle of unique prime factorization and the formula for calculating the number of divisors based on prime factorization exponents.
*   **Sieve of Eratosthenes (Modified):**  The efficient prime factorization is achieved through precomputation using a modified Sieve of Eratosthenes. Instead of just marking primes, this implementation stores the *smallest* prime factor of each number. This dramatically speeds up the factorization process for numbers within the precomputed range.
*   **Efficient Factorization:**  By precomputing the smallest prime factors, the code can iteratively divide the input number *x* by its smallest prime factor until *x* becomes 1. This is much faster than trial division with all numbers up to sqrt(x).

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   **Precomputation (Sieve):** O(MAX log log MAX).  The Sieve of Eratosthenes has a time complexity of approximately O(n log log n), where n is MAX in this case.
    *   **Prime Factorization (per query):** O(log x) in practice because the algorithm divides by the smallest prime at each stage, greatly reducing x in each step.  In the worst case, if a number is power of a single prime close to MAX, this could be O(number of divisions by prime), but with the sieve, the number to divide is quickly reduced.
    *   **Overall:**  O(MAX log log MAX + n log x), where *n* is the number of test cases.  Since x <= MAX, the second term is at most O(n log MAX).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(MAX) due to the `prime` vector.

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **Precomputation for Optimization:** The code demonstrates the powerful technique of precomputing values to optimize repeated computations. Precomputing the smallest prime factors using the Sieve significantly improves the speed of the prime factorization process.
*   **Modified Sieve:**  Storing the smallest prime factor instead of simply marking primes allows for direct and efficient prime factorization. This is a key optimization.
*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:**  This optimization disables synchronization between the C++ standard input/output streams and the C standard input/output streams, and unties `cin` from `cout`, resulting in faster input/output.
*   **`#define int long long`:** Using this macro avoids potential integer overflow issues by using 64-bit integers instead of 32-bit integers by default. This is particularly important when dealing with potentially large numbers of divisors.

## 6. Any Edge Cases Handled

*   **x <= 1:** The `primeFactorization` function has a check for x <= 1, which returns an empty vector, effectively handling inputs of 0 and 1 correctly (they have 1 divisor).

## Learning Points

*   **Prime Factorization:** This code demonstrates an efficient method for prime factorization using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
*   **Sieve Optimization:**  Storing the smallest prime factor in the Sieve is a crucial optimization for factorization.
*   **Precomputation:** Precomputation can significantly speed up solutions for problems where certain calculations are repeated frequently.
*   **Number Theory Concepts:**  Understanding fundamental number theory concepts like prime factorization and the number of divisors formula is crucial for solving problems in this domain.
*   **Integer Overflow:**  Be mindful of potential integer overflow issues and use `long long` when necessary.
