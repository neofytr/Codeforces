# Problem: Codeforces 414B - Mashmokh and ACM

## 1. Problem Description

This solution addresses the Codeforces problem 414B, titled "Mashmokh and ACM" (available at [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/414/B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/414/B)).

The problem asks us to find the number of increasing sequences of length *k* such that each element in the sequence is a divisor of the next element, and all elements in the sequence are between 1 and *n* (inclusive).

For example, if *n* = 6 and *k* = 2, the possible sequences are:

*   (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)
*   (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6)
*   (3, 3), (3, 6)
*   (4, 4)
*   (5, 5)
*   (6, 6)

## 2. Approach Explanation

The solution uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid sequences.

*   `dp[r][s]` represents the number of increasing sequences of length `r` ending with the number `s`.

The core idea is to build the `dp` table iteratively:

1.  **Base Case:** For sequences of length 1 (i.e., `r = 1`), any number from 1 to `n` is a valid sequence of length 1.  Therefore, `dp[1][s] = 1` for all `s` from 1 to `n`.

2.  **Recursive Step:** For sequences of length `r` (where `r > 1`), to find the number of sequences ending with `s`, we iterate through all possible divisors `j` of `s`. For each divisor `j`, we can extend any sequence of length `r - 1` ending with `j` to a sequence of length `r` ending with `s`.  Therefore, we add `dp[r - 1][j]` to `dp[r][s]` for each divisor `j` of `s`.

3.  **Final Answer:** The answer is the sum of `dp[k][s]` for all `s` from 1 to `n`, because any sequence of length `k` ending with any number from 1 to `n` is a valid sequence.

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Dynamic Programming:** The problem exhibits optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, making dynamic programming a suitable approach.
*   **Divisor Iteration:**  The efficient `for (int j = 1; j * j <= s; j++)` loop cleverly finds all divisors of `s` in O(sqrt(s)) time.  By checking `s % j == 0`, we determine if `j` is a divisor.  If `j` is a divisor, `s / j` is also a divisor.  We handle the case where `j == s / j` (i.e., `j` is the square root of `s`) to avoid double-counting.  This is far more efficient than iterating from 1 to `s`.
*   **Modulo Arithmetic:** The use of `MOD (1000000000 + 7)` prevents integer overflow during the calculations. Remember to apply the modulo operator after each addition to ensure the result stays within the valid range.
*   **Bottom-Up Approach:**  The dynamic programming solution uses a bottom-up (iterative) approach to build the `dp` table, starting from the base cases and iteratively building up to the desired solution.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** The outer loop iterates from `r = 2` to `k` (O(k)).  The next loop iterates from `s = 1` to `n` (O(n)). The innermost loop for finding divisors takes O(sqrt(s)) time.  Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(k * n * sqrt(n)).

*   **Space Complexity:** The `dp` table has dimensions `(k + 1) x (n + 1)`, so the space complexity is O(k * n).

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`#define int long long`:**  This is a common trick in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow issues when dealing with large numbers.  It redefines `int` as `long long`, providing a larger range for integer values. The corresponding change to `main` function signature `int32_t main()` is required for proper compilation.
*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:** This optimization disables synchronization between the C++ standard streams and the C standard streams, and unties `cin` and `cout`, potentially speeding up input/output operations.  This is especially helpful when dealing with large input sizes.
*   **Efficient Divisor Calculation:** The `for (int j = 1; j * j <= s; j++)` loop is a standard way to find all divisors of a number efficiently.

## 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   The code handles the case where `j == s / j` correctly by only adding `dp[r - 1][j]` once to `dp[r][s]`.
*   The problem statement indicates that the input values n and k are likely to be relatively large and that overflows need to be considered. The MOD value is included to prevent integer overflows during calculations by taking the modulo of the results with a sufficiently large prime number after each arithmetic operation.
*   The problem does not contain specific edge cases involving invalid input. The code assumes that `n` and `k` will be within the expected ranges.
