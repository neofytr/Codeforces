## Documentation: PrimePrime Numbers

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the provided C++ code, which solves the "microAndPrimePrime" problem from Hackerearth ( [https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/math/number-theory/primality-tests/practice-problems/algorithm/micro-and-prime-prime-1/](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/math/number-theory/primality-tests/practice-problems/algorithm/micro-and-prime-prime-1/) ).

### 1. Problem Description

The problem asks us to determine, for a given range `[l, r]`, how many numbers `x` within that range are "primePrime". A number `x` is considered "primePrime" if the number of prime numbers less than or equal to `x` is itself a prime number.

More formally:

*   Let `pi(x)` denote the number of prime numbers less than or equal to `x`.
*   A number `x` is "primePrime" if `pi(x)` is a prime number.

The task is to count the number of primePrime numbers within a given range `[l, r]`.

### 2. Approach Explanation

The code employs a precomputation-based approach to efficiently answer multiple range queries.  It precalculates the following:

1.  **Primes:** Using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, it identifies all prime numbers up to `MAX`.
2.  **Prime Count Prefix Sum:**  It calculates a prefix sum array `prefix`, where `prefix[r]` stores the number of prime numbers in the range `[1, r]`.  This represents the value of `pi(r)`.
3.  **PrimePrime Count Prefix Sum:** It calculates another prefix sum array `pp`, where `pp[r]` stores the number of "primePrime" numbers in the range `[1, r]`.  This is achieved by checking if `prefix[r]` is a prime number itself and, if so, incrementing the count.

With these precomputed arrays, answering a query for the range `[l, r]` becomes a simple matter of calculating `pp[r] - pp[l - 1]`.  This gives the number of primePrime numbers within the specified range.

### 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Sieve of Eratosthenes:**  This is the fundamental algorithm used to efficiently find all prime numbers up to a given limit.  Its time complexity is O(n log log n), where n is the limit.
*   **Prefix Sums:**  Prefix sums are used to efficiently calculate the number of primes and primePrime numbers within a range. This technique allows range queries to be answered in O(1) time after the initial precomputation.
*   **Precomputation:**  The problem involves multiple queries, making precomputation a very efficient strategy. By precalculating the necessary information, the time complexity of each query is drastically reduced.
*   **Bitset for Prime Tracking:** `bitset<MAX + 1> prime` is used to efficiently store and query whether a number is prime.  Bitsets are memory-efficient when dealing with boolean values.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   Sieve of Eratosthenes: O(MAX log log MAX)
    *   Prime Count Prefix Sum: O(MAX)
    *   PrimePrime Count Prefix Sum: O(MAX)
    *   Query (per range [l, r]): O(1)
    *   Overall: O(MAX log log MAX) + O(t) , where `t` is the number of test cases.  The precomputation dominates.

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   `prefix`: O(MAX)
    *   `pp`: O(MAX)
    *   `prime`: O(MAX)  (more precisely, MAX bits)
    *   Overall: O(MAX)

### 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:** This is a common optimization technique in C++ competitive programming to disable synchronization between C and C++ streams, improving input/output performance.
*   **`#define int long long`:**  This redefines the `int` type to `long long` to avoid potential integer overflow issues, especially when dealing with larger numbers.
*   **`bitset` for Boolean Array:** The code effectively utilizes `std::bitset` to store boolean values (prime or not prime) in a memory-efficient manner. This is crucial when dealing with a large range of numbers.
*   **Prefix Sum Calculation:** The way `prefix` and `pp` arrays are generated leverages prefix sum technique to calculate count of primes and primePrime numbers respectively within any given range efficiently.

### 6. Any Edge Cases Handled

*   **Base Cases in Sieve:** The code correctly handles the base cases in the Sieve of Eratosthenes by setting `prime[0]` and `prime[1]` to `false`.
*   **Handling `l - 1` in Query:** When calculating `pp[r] - pp[l - 1]`, the code correctly handles the case where `l` is 1. `pp[0]` is initialized to 0, so `pp[1] - pp[0]` is equivalent to the number of primePrimes in the range [1,1].
*   **Integer Overflow:** The use of `long long` data type mitigates the risk of integer overflow, which can occur when dealing with large numbers, especially in the prefix sum calculations.  It's implicitly handling cases where the number of primes within a range could become large.
