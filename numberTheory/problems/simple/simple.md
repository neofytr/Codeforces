## Code Documentation: Simple Primality Test Problem

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the provided C++ code, covering its purpose, algorithmic approach, and implementation details.

### 1. Problem Description

Based on the code and comments, the problem likely originates from Codeforces, specifically [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2093/C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2093/C). The problem statement (inferred) is as follows:

Given two integers, `x` and `k`, determine if a specific condition based on `x` and `k` is met. The code suggests the condition relates to primality and the value of `k`. Specifically:

*   If `k > 1` and `x > 1`, output "NO".
*   If `k == 1`, output "YES" if `x` is prime, and "NO" otherwise.
*   If `k == 2`, output "YES".

The problem, therefore, seems to involve testing if `x` is prime only when `k` is equal to 1, and determining whether the condition is met otherwise.

### 2. Approach Explanation

The solution uses a straightforward conditional approach:

1.  **Read Inputs:** The code first reads the number of test cases `t`.  For each test case, it reads the integers `x` and `k`.

2.  **Handle Conditions:** It then uses a series of `if-else if-else` statements to evaluate the given conditions:
    *   `if (k > 1 && x > 1)`:  If `k` is greater than 1 and `x` is greater than 1, it outputs "NO".
    *   `else if (k == 1)`: If `k` is equal to 1, it calls the `is_prime` function to check if `x` is a prime number. If `x` is prime, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".
    *   `else`:  This handles the case where `k` is not greater than 1 and is not equal to 1, thus, `k` is equal to 2. In this case, it outputs "YES".

3.  **Primality Test:**  The `is_prime` function implements a standard primality test algorithm.

### 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Primality Test:** The core of the solution is the `is_prime` function, which implements a standard and efficient primality test algorithm. It avoids unnecessary checks by:
    *   Handling base cases for `n <= 1`, `n <= 3`.
    *   Checking divisibility by 2 and 3.
    *   Iterating only up to the square root of `n`.
    *   Incrementing the iterator by 6, leveraging the fact that all primes greater than 3 can be expressed in the form `6k ± 1`.

*   **Conditional Logic:** The problem is solved using a series of simple `if-else if-else` statements to determine the correct output based on the values of `x` and `k`. This demonstrates the importance of carefully analyzing the problem's conditions and implementing them directly in code.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   The `is_prime` function has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), where n is the input number.
    *   The main loop iterates `t` times, and the operations within the loop take constant time, except for the `is_prime` function call.  Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(t * sqrt(x)), where x is the input integer to the is_prime function.
*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   The space complexity is O(1) because the code uses only a constant amount of extra space for variables.  The `is_prime` function also uses only a constant amount of extra space.

### 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(nullptr);`:** This optimization disables synchronization between C++ streams and the standard C I/O library, potentially improving the input/output performance of the code.  This is common practice in competitive programming.
*   **`#define int long long`:** This preprocessor directive redefines the `int` type as `long long`. This is often used to prevent integer overflow issues, especially when dealing with large numbers.  It's crucial to understand the problem's constraints to determine if this is necessary.
*   **Primality test optimization:** The primality test is optimized by only checking divisors up to the square root of `n`, and by skipping multiples of 2 and 3.  The increment of 6 in the `for` loop (`i += 6`) further optimizes the process by only checking numbers of the form 6k ± 1.

### 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   **`n <= 1` in `is_prime`:** The `is_prime` function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is less than or equal to 1 (not prime).
*   **`k > 1 && x > 1`:** The code explicitly handles the condition where both k and x are greater than 1, outputting "NO", as per the problem's requirement.
*   The condition `k == 2` is directly handled ensuring it outputs "YES".

In summary, this code efficiently addresses a problem involving primality testing and conditional logic. It demonstrates a good understanding of basic algorithmic techniques, optimization strategies, and edge case handling.
