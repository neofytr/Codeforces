# Code Documentation: Counting Divisors

This document analyzes a C++ solution to the "Counting Divisors" problem, which can be found at [https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1713](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1713) on the CSES problemset.

## 1. Problem Description

The problem requires you to calculate the number of divisors for a given set of integers.  Given *n* integers, for each integer *x*, the program should output the number of divisors of *x*.

## 2. Approach Explanation

The solution employs a combination of prime factorization and a precomputed maximum prime factor table to efficiently count the number of divisors for each input number.

1.  **Precomputation (Sieve-like approach):** It precomputes the largest prime factor for all numbers up to `MAX` (1,000,000). This is done using a modified sieve of Eratosthenes, storing the largest prime factor found for each number.

2.  **Prime Factorization:**  For each input number *x*, the code iteratively divides *x* by its largest prime factor (obtained from the precomputed table) until *x* becomes 1. During this process, it keeps track of the exponent of each prime factor.

3.  **Counting Divisors:** The number of divisors is calculated using the formula: If the prime factorization of *x* is  *p<sub>1</sub><sup>a<sub>1</sub></sup> * p<sub>2</sub><sup>a<sub>2</sub></sup> * ... * p<sub>k</sub><sup>a<sub>k</sub></sup>*, then the number of divisors of *x* is *(a<sub>1</sub> + 1) * (a<sub>2</sub> + 1) * ... * (a<sub>k</sub> + 1)*.

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Prime Factorization:** The core idea is to efficiently find the prime factors of the input number.  Using the precomputed maximum prime factor table dramatically speeds up this process.

*   **Sieve of Eratosthenes (Modified):**  The solution uses a modified sieve to find the largest prime factor of each number up to `MAX`. Instead of marking multiples as composite, it stores the smallest prime factor that divides a number.  This avoids repeated divisions in the main loop.

*   **Number of Divisors Formula:**  The formula `(a1 + 1) * (a2 + 1) * ... * (ak + 1)` is the foundation for counting divisors once the prime factorization is known.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   **Precomputation:** The sieve-like precomputation has a time complexity of approximately O(MAX log log MAX), which is almost linear.
    *   **Prime Factorization (per number):**  The prime factorization for each input number *x* takes O(log x) on average (due to the precomputed largest prime factors), but at worst O(sqrt(x)) without the sieve. With precomputation, the factorization takes very little time as it is already partially factored. The number of iterations depends on the number of distinct prime factors and their exponents.  In practice, this is much faster than general factorization.
    *   **Overall:**  O(MAX log log MAX + n * log x) where x is on average the average input. If all x are close to MAX, it becomes O(MAX log log MAX + n * log MAX).

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   The `maxPrime` vector takes O(MAX) space.
    *   Other variables use constant space.
    *   Therefore, the space complexity is O(MAX).

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`#define int long long`:** This is a common trick in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow issues when dealing with large numbers (especially when calculating products).

*   **Precomputation:**  Precomputing the largest prime factor dramatically speeds up the process of counting divisors.

*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:** These lines optimize input/output operations, making the program run faster.

*   **Using `while (!(x % p))` to efficiently divide by a prime factor:** This neatly handles the exponents of prime factors in the factorization.

## 6. Any Edge Cases Handled

*   **x = 1:** The `while (x != 1)` loop handles the case when the input number is 1 correctly (it doesn't enter the loop, and the initial value of `cnt` which is 1 remains unchanged). The number of divisors of 1 is 1.
*   The code implicitly handles prime numbers as inputs. The precomputed table will show the number as its own prime factor.
