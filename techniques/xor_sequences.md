# XOR Sequence Problem: Detailed Solution and Proof

## Problem Statement

We have two distinct non-negative integers $x$ and $y$.
We define two infinite sequences:
- $a_n = n \oplus x$ for $n \geq 1$
- $b_n = n \oplus y$ for $n \geq 1$

Where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

The task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment of sequences $a$ and $b$. In other words, find the maximum integer $m$ such that $a_i = b_j, a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}, \ldots, a_{i+m-1} = b_{j+m-1}$ for some $i, j \geq 1$.

## Solution Overview

The key to solving this problem lies in understanding:
1. The relationship between indices $i$ and $j$ when $a_i = b_j$
2. How far we can extend this relationship for consecutive elements
3. The properties of XOR that govern when this relationship breaks

## XOR Properties Used

Before diving into the solution, let's review some key properties of XOR that we'll use:

1. **Commutativity**: $a \oplus b = b \oplus a$
2. **Associativity**: $(a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c)$
3. **Identity element**: $a \oplus 0 = a$
4. **Self-inverse**: $a \oplus a = 0$
5. **Cancellation**: If $a \oplus b = c$, then $a \oplus c = b$ and $b \oplus c = a$

## Detailed Proof

### Step 1: Finding the Relationship Between Matching Indices

For any indices $i$ in sequence $a$ and $j$ in sequence $b$ where the values match:

$a_i = b_j$

This means:
$i \oplus x = j \oplus y$

To isolate $j$, we can XOR both sides with $y$:
$(i \oplus x) \oplus y = (j \oplus y) \oplus y$

Using the self-inverse property of XOR ($y \oplus y = 0$) and identity property ($j \oplus 0 = j$):
$(i \oplus x) \oplus y = j$

Using associativity:
$j = i \oplus (x \oplus y)$

This means if we have a match at position $i$ in sequence $a$, it corresponds to position $j = i \oplus (x \oplus y)$ in sequence $b$.

### Step 2: Extending to Consecutive Elements

For a subsegment of length $m$, we need:
- $a_i = b_j$
- $a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}$
- $a_{i+2} = b_{j+2}$
- ...
- $a_{i+m-1} = b_{j+m-1}$

We already know $j = i \oplus (x \oplus y)$ for the first match.

For the second element:
$a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}$

This expands to:
$(i+1) \oplus x = (j+1) \oplus y$

Substituting $j = i \oplus (x \oplus y)$:
$(i+1) \oplus x = (i \oplus (x \oplus y) + 1) \oplus y$

Now, here's the critical insight: the relationship continues to hold precisely until adding 1 creates a carry that affects a bit position where $x \oplus y$ has a 1.

### Step 3: When Does the Pattern Break?

Let's define $z = x \oplus y$ for simplicity.

The relationship $j = i \oplus z$ means that when we increment $i$ and $j$, the pattern continues as long as incrementing $i$ and incrementing $i \oplus z$ have the "same effect" on their respective XOR results.

When does incrementing $i \oplus z$ differ from incrementing $i$? This happens when adding 1 creates a carry that affects a bit where $z$ has a 1.

Consider the binary representation. When we add 1 to a number:
- If the least significant bit is 0, we simply flip it to 1
- If the least significant bit is 1, we set it to 0 and carry the 1 to the next bit
- This "carrying" continues until we find a 0 bit that we can flip to 1

The pattern breaks when this carrying process affects a bit position where $z$ has a 1.

### Step 4: Finding the Maximum Length

Let's say the least significant bit (LSB) in $z = x \oplus y$ is at position $k$ (0-indexed from the right).

This means:
- Bits 0 to $k-1$ in $z$ are all 0
- Bit $k$ in $z$ is 1

The longest possible subsegment will start at some position $i$ and continue until adding 1 to $i$ causes a carry that reaches bit position $k$.

The maximum number of elements before this happens is $2^k$. Why?
- If we start at a number where bits 0 to $k-1$ are all 0, we can increment it $2^k - 1$ times before a carry affects bit $k$
- If we start at any other number, the subsegment will be shorter

Therefore, the answer is $2^k$, where $k$ is the position of the least significant set bit in $x \oplus y$.

## Implementation Details

In code, we can find the position of the least significant set bit by repeatedly shifting right and checking the lowest bit:

```cpp
long long xor_val = x ^ y;
long long result = 1;
while ((xor_val & 1) == 0) {
    result *= 2;
    xor_val >>= 1;
}
return result;
```

This gives us $2^k$ where $k$ is the position of the lowest set bit in $x \oplus y$.

## Concrete Example

Let's illustrate with a small example: $x = 5$ and $y = 2$

1. Calculate $x \oplus y = 5 \oplus 2 = 7$ (in binary: $101 \oplus 010 = 111$)
2. The least significant set bit in $7$ is at position 0 (the rightmost bit)
3. So the length of the longest common subsegment is $2^0 = 1$

Let's verify:
- Sequence $a$: $a_1 = 1 \oplus 5 = 4$, $a_2 = 2 \oplus 5 = 7$, $a_3 = 3 \oplus 5 = 6$, ...
- Sequence $b$: $b_1 = 1 \oplus 2 = 3$, $b_2 = 2 \oplus 2 = 0$, $b_3 = 3 \oplus 2 = 1$, ...

Indeed, there are no matching subsequences of length greater than 1.

Another example: $x = 10$ and $y = 8$

1. Calculate $x \oplus y = 10 \oplus 8 = 2$ (in binary: $1010 \oplus 1000 = 0010$)
2. The least significant set bit in $2$ is at position 1
3. So the length of the longest common subsegment is $2^1 = 2$

Verify:
- Sequence $a$: $a_1 = 1 \oplus 10 = 11$, $a_2 = 2 \oplus 10 = 8$, $a_3 = 3 \oplus 10 = 9$, ...
- Sequence $b$: $b_1 = 1 \oplus 8 = 9$, $b_2 = 2 \oplus 8 = 10$, $b_3 = 3 \oplus 8 = 11$, ...

We can see that $a_3 = b_1 = 9$ and $a_1 = b_3 = 11$, giving two subsegments of length 1. There are no subsegments of length greater than 2.

## Conclusion

The key insight is understanding how the bitwise XOR interacts with incrementation. The longest common subsegment is determined by the position of the least significant bit in $x \oplus y$, which is precisely the point where the relationship between incremented values breaks down.

The solution has a time complexity of O(log(x âŠ• y)), making it very efficient even for large inputs.
