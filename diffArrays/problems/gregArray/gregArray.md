## Competitive Programming Solution Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the given C++ competitive programming solution.

### 1. Problem Description

The problem involves processing a series of array updates based on a set of operations defined by queries. We are given an initial array `arr` of size `n`, a set of `m` queries, and `k` update instructions. Each query specifies a range `[l, r]` and a value `x`. Each update instruction specifies another range `[l, r]`.  For each update instruction, all queries in the range defined by update instruction should apply updates `arr[i] += x` for all array indices `i` in range `[l, r]` defined by the query.  The goal is to compute the final updated array `arr`.

More formally:

*   **Input:**
    *   `n`: Size of the initial array `arr`.
    *   `m`: Number of queries.
    *   `k`: Number of update instructions.
    *   `arr`: The initial array of `n` integers.
    *   `queries`: A list of `m` tuples `(l, r, x)`, where `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the range (0-indexed) to be updated by `x`.
    *   Update Instructions: A list of `k` tuples `(l, r)`, representing the range of queries to apply.

*   **Output:** The final updated array `arr`.

### 2. Approach Explanation

The solution uses a combination of prefix sums and difference arrays to efficiently apply the updates. The core idea is to avoid iterating through the array `arr` for each update instruction.  Instead, it efficiently counts the number of times each query needs to be applied and then applies those updates to the array using prefix sums.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1.  **Read Input:** Reads the input values `n`, `m`, `k`, the initial array `arr`, and the list of queries.  Note that the query indices are converted to 0-based indexing.

2.  **Count Query Applications:** The `ops` vector is used to count how many times each query is applied based on the `k` update instructions.  This is done using the difference array technique. For each update instruction `(l, r)`, `ops[l]` is incremented and `ops[r+1]` is decremented.  After processing all `k` instructions, a prefix sum is computed on `ops` so that `ops[i]` represents the number of times the i-th query is to be applied.

3.  **Apply Query Updates using Prefix Sums:** Another difference array, `prefix`, is used to efficiently apply the effects of the queries to the array.  For each query `(l, r, x)` and its application count `ops[i]`, `prefix[l]` is incremented by `ops[i] * x`, and `prefix[r+1]` is decremented by `ops[i] * x`. After processing all queries, a prefix sum is computed on `prefix`. This means `prefix[i]` holds the total update to be applied at index `i` of the array.

4.  **Update Array:** Finally, each element `arr[i]` is updated by adding `prefix[i]` to it.

5.  **Print Result:** Prints the final updated array.

### 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Difference Array:** The `ops` and `prefix` vectors are used as difference arrays. This is a crucial technique for efficiently applying range updates.  Incrementing `ops[l]` and decrementing `ops[r+1]` creates a delta that, when processed with a prefix sum, effectively adds 1 to `ops[l]` through `ops[r]` and nothing beyond. The same logic applies to `prefix`.
*   **Prefix Sum:** The prefix sum operation is used twice.  First, to transform the `ops` difference array into an array containing the number of times each query is executed. Second, to transform the `prefix` difference array into an array containing the actual values to add to each index of `arr`.
*   **Offline Processing:** The solution processes all the queries and update instructions before applying any actual updates to the array. This is a characteristic of offline algorithms, allowing for efficient manipulation of updates.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   Reading Input: O(n + m + k)
    *   Counting Query Applications: O(k + m) (k for the instructions and m for prefix sum)
    *   Applying Query Updates: O(m + n) (m for going through queries and n for prefix sum)
    *   Updating Array: O(n)
    *   Printing Result: O(n)

    Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n + m + k)**.

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   `arr`: O(n)
    *   `queries`: O(m)
    *   `ops`: O(m)
    *   `prefix`: O(n)

    Therefore, the overall space complexity is **O(n + m)**.

### 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`#define int long long`:** This macro redefines the `int` type to `long long`. This is a common practice in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow issues, especially when dealing with large input values. It's important to be aware of this when analyzing the code.
*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:** These lines disable synchronization between C++ standard streams and the underlying C standard streams, and unties `cin` from `cout`, which can significantly improve the input/output performance of the program.
*   **Range-based for loops:** Using `for (int &val : arr)` and `for (auto &[p, x] : queries)` provides cleaner and more readable code compared to traditional index-based loops. The auto& allows to update the vector in place.
*   **`p.first--, p.second--;`:** Converting to 0-based indexing immediately after reading the input simplifies the rest of the code.
*   **Difference Array Pattern:** Increment the start and decrement the end+1 position.

### 6. Any Edge Cases Handled

*   The code correctly handles the case when the update range `r` goes to the end of array by decrementing `ops[r + 1]` or `prefix[r + 1]` instead of indexing beyond the end of the array.
*   The `#define int long long` handles potential overflows.

## Original Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define int long long

int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n, m, k;
    cin >> n >> m >> k;
    vector<int> arr(n);
    for (int &val : arr)
        cin >> val;

    vector<pair<pair<int, int>, int>> queries(m);
    for (auto &[p, x] : queries) {
        cin >> p.first >> p.second >> x;
        p.first--, p.second--; // convert to 0-based
    }

    // count how many times each operation is applied
    vector<int> ops(m + 1, 0);
    while (k--) {
        int l, r;
        cin >> l >> r;
        l--, r--;
        ops[l] += 1;
        ops[r + 1] -= 1;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) // prefix sum on ops (size m)
        ops[i] += ops[i - 1];

    vector<int> prefix(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        auto [p, x] = queries[i];
        int l = p.first, r = p.second;
        prefix[l] += ops[i] * x;
        prefix[r + 1] -= ops[i] * x;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        prefix[i] += prefix[i - 1];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        arr[i] += prefix[i];

    for (int val : arr)
        cout << val << " ";
    cout << "\n";
    return 0;
}

```
