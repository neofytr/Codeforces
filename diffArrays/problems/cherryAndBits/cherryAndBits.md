# Problem: Cherry and Bits

This code solves the "Cherry and Bits" problem from CodeChef CENS2020 (https://www.codechef.com/CENS2020/problems/CENS20A). The problem involves a binary matrix and a series of queries. Each query specifies a rectangular region within the matrix. Applying a query flips the value of each cell within the specified rectangle.  After processing all queries, the code outputs the final state of the matrix.

## Approach Explanation

The solution utilizes the concept of **difference arrays** and **prefix sums** to efficiently handle the multiple update queries on the matrix.  Directly flipping the bits in the specified rectangles for each query would be inefficient (O(q * n * m) in the worst case, where 'q' is the number of queries, and 'n' and 'm' are the dimensions of the matrix).

Instead, the code follows these steps:

1. **Input and Matrix Initialization:** Reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the binary matrix, the matrix elements as strings, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Difference Array Creation:**  A `diff` array of size `(n+1) x (m+1)` is created and initialized to all zeros. This array stores the *differences* resulting from the queries. For each query (x1, y1, x2, y2), the `diff` array is updated as follows:

   * `diff[y1][x1] += 1;`
   * `diff[y1][x2 + 1] -= 1;`
   * `diff[y2 + 1][x1] -= 1;`
   * `diff[y2 + 1][x2 + 1] += 1;`

   This cleverly encodes the rectangular update in a way that allows for efficient processing using prefix sums later.  Each '1' adds an area, and each '-1' subtracts part of the created area, forming the target rectangle.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**  A `prefix` array of size `(n+1) x (m+1)` is computed from the `diff` array.  Each element `prefix[i][j]` stores the sum of all elements in the rectangle defined by `diff[0][0]` to `diff[i-1][j-1]`.  This is a standard 2D prefix sum calculation:

   * `prefix[row][col] = prefix[row - 1][col] + prefix[row][col - 1] - prefix[row - 1][col - 1] + diff[row - 1][col - 1];`

4. **Applying Updates and Output:** Finally, the code iterates through the original matrix. For each element `arr[row][col]`, it checks if `prefix[row + 1][col + 1]` is odd. If it is, it means that the element has been flipped an odd number of times due to the queries, so it's flipped (using `!arr[row][col]`). Otherwise, it remains unchanged. The updated matrix is then printed to the console.

## Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Difference Arrays:** The core idea is the use of a difference array. This allows us to represent range updates (flipping the bits in the rectangle) as point updates in the `diff` array. The four updates to the `diff` array represent adding and subtracting areas in a way that a prefix sum calculation can efficiently recover the number of flips for each cell.
*   **Prefix Sums:**  The 2D prefix sum efficiently calculates the cumulative effect of all the queries on each cell.  This avoids the need to iterate through all the queries for each cell, leading to a much faster solution.
*   **Modulo Operation for Flipping:** `prefix[row + 1][col + 1] & 1` is an efficient way to check if the number of flips is odd. The result is 1 (true) if odd and 0 (false) if even.  This eliminates the need for a modulo 2 operator.

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   Initialization of matrix and reading input: O(n * m)
    *   Processing `q` queries to update `diff` array: O(q)
    *   Calculating the `prefix` array: O(n * m)
    *   Applying updates and printing the matrix: O(n * m)

    Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n * m + q)**.

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   Original matrix `arr`: O(n * m)
    *   `diff` array: O(n * m)
    *   `prefix` array: O(n * m)

    Thus, the space complexity is **O(n * m)**.

## Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **Difference Array and Prefix Sum Combination:** This combination is a powerful technique for handling range updates and point queries efficiently.
*   **Bitwise AND for Parity Check:** `prefix[row + 1][col + 1] & 1` is a faster alternative to `prefix[row + 1][col + 1] % 2` for checking if a number is odd.
*   **Using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(NULL);`:** This optimizes input/output operations by disabling synchronization between C++ streams and C streams, which can improve performance, especially for large datasets.

## Edge Cases Handled

*   The code initializes the `diff` and `prefix` arrays to size `(n+1) x (m+1)` to avoid out-of-bounds access when calculating prefix sums at the borders.
*   The problem statement and URL suggests the problem is designed for large test cases where an inefficient implementation would exceed the time limit. The use of difference arrays and prefix sums makes this implementation efficient enough to solve the test cases within the allowed time.
