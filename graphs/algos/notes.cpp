    // The bellman-ford algorithm is a simple algorithm that finds shortest paths from a starting node
    // to all other nodes. Dijkstra's algorithm is a more efficient algorithm which requires that
    // all edge weights are non-negative. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm determines shortest paths
    // between all node pairs of a graph.

    // a graph consists of nodes that are connected with edges
    // a path leads from a node to another node through the edges of the graph
    // a simple path is a one that does not repeat any edges/nodes
    // the length of a path is the number of edges in it
    // a cycle is a path where the first and the last node is the same
    // a graph is connected if there is a path between any two nodes
    // the connected parts of a graph are called it's components
    // a tree is a connected graph that does that contain any cycles

    // a connected graph of n nodes has atleast n - 1 edges

    // A graph G is a tree iff
    // 1. G is acyclic and connected
    // 2. G is connected and has exactly n - 1 edges
    // 3. G is acyclic and adding any edge would introduce a cycle
    // 4. G is connected and removing any edge would disconnect it
    // 5. There exists exactly one simple path between any two vertices
    // 6. G has no cycles and has the maximum possible number of edges without forming a cycle
    // 7. G is connected and its edges are all bridges (removing any edge increases components)

    // in a directed graph, the edges can be traversed in only one direction
    // in a weighted graph, each edge is assigned a weight
    // two nodes are adjacent if there is an edge between them
    // the degree of a node is the number of nodes adjacent to it

    // the sum of degree of all nodes in the graph is two times the number of edges in the graph since each edge of the graph increases
    // the degree of exactly two nodes by 1

    // a graph is regular if the degree of all nodes is exactly d
    // a graph is complete if the degree of all nodes is  n - 1, where n is the number of nodes in the graph
    // a complete graph of n vertices has n * (n - 1) / 2 edges

    // in a directed graph, the indegree of a node is the number of incoming edges to the node, and
    // the outdegree is the number of outgoing edges from the node

    // a graph is bipartite if it's possible to color all of its vertices in such a manner that if there
    // is an edge between vertices u and v, then they both have a different color

    // a graph is bipartite iff it has no cycle that contains an odd number of nodes

    // both bfs and dfs are fundamental graph algoithms that are given a starting node in the graph, and
    // they visit all nodes that can reached from the starting node
    // the difference in the algorithms is the order in which they visit the nodes

    // using the graph traversal algorithms, we can have the following applications

    // 1. Connectivity Check
    // a graph is connected if there is a path between any two nodes in the graph
    // thus, we can check if a graph is connected by starting at an arbitrary node and
    // finding out if we can reach all the other nodes
    // in a similar way, we can find all the connected components of a graph by iterating through
    // the nodes and always starting a new dfs if the current node does not belong to any component yet

    // 2. Cycle Detection
    // a graph contains a cycle if during a graph traversal, we find a node whose neighbour
    // (other than the previous node in the current path, i.e, it's parent) has already been visited

    /*
    Another  way  to  determine  if  a  graph  contains  a  cycle  is  to  simply  calculate  the
    number  of  nodes  and  edges  in  every  component.  If  a  component  contains c nodes
    and  no  cycle,  it  must  contain  exactly c âˆ’ 1 edges  (so  it  has  to  be  a  tree).  If  there  are
    c or  more  edges,  the  component  surely  contains  a  cycle.
