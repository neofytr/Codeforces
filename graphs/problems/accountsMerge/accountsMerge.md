## Accounts Merge Problem Analysis and Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the provided C++ code, which solves the "Accounts Merge" problem on LeetCode.

**1. Problem Description**

The "Accounts Merge" problem (available at [https://leetcode.com/problems/accounts-merge/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/accounts-merge/description/)) presents the following challenge:

Given a list of accounts, where each account `accounts[i]` is a list of strings representing the name and email addresses for the i-th account.  The first element of `accounts[i]` is the name of the account owner, and the rest of the elements are email addresses.

The goal is to merge accounts that belong to the same person. Two accounts belong to the same person if they have at least one email address in common.

After merging the accounts, return a list of accounts in the following format: The first element of each account is the name of the account owner, and the rest of the elements are the email addresses in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.

**2. Approach Explanation**

The provided solution utilizes a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to efficiently merge accounts belonging to the same person. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Mapping Emails to IDs:** An `unordered_map` named `emailToId` is used to assign a unique integer ID to each distinct email address encountered across all accounts.  Another `unordered_map` named `idToEmail` stores the reverse mapping, allowing retrieval of the email address from its assigned ID. A `emailToName` map stores the name associated with each email address.
2. **DSU Initialization:** A `DSU` object is initialized with the number of unique email addresses as its size.  Initially, each email address is in its own disjoint set.
3. **Union Operations:** The code iterates through each account and performs union operations using the DSU. For each account, all email addresses within the account are united into a single set.  The first email in the account is used as the representative of the group, and all other emails are unioned with it. This effectively merges accounts sharing at least one email.
4. **Grouping Emails by Root:** After the union operations, an `unordered_map` named `groups` is used to group email IDs by their root (representative) in the DSU. The `find` operation of the DSU is used to determine the root of each email ID.
5. **Constructing Result Accounts:** Finally, the code iterates through the `groups` map. For each root, it retrieves the associated email IDs, converts them back to email addresses using `idToEmail`, sorts them, and adds the name of the account owner (retrieved from `emailToName`) as the first element. This creates a merged account in the required format, which is then appended to the `result` vector.

**3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used**

*   **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):** The core of the solution is the DSU data structure. DSU allows efficient tracking of connected components (in this case, groups of email addresses belonging to the same person).  The `find` operation, with path compression, provides near-constant time complexity for finding the representative of a set. The `unite` operation merges two sets efficiently.
*   **Hash Maps:**  `unordered_map`s are crucial for fast lookups of email addresses to IDs, IDs to email addresses, and email to names. This dramatically speeds up the process of merging and reconstructing the accounts.
*   **Mapping to Integers:** Mapping email addresses to unique integer IDs enables the use of the DSU data structure, which is generally implemented with integer indices.
*   **Path Compression:**  The `find` method in the DSU class uses path compression optimization, which significantly improves the efficiency of the DSU operations.  Path compression makes future `find` operations on nodes along the compressed path faster.

**4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis**

*   **Time Complexity:**

    *   Creating the `emailToId`, `idToEmail` and `emailToName` maps: O(N * M), where N is the number of accounts and M is the average number of emails per account.
    *   DSU initialization: O(K), where K is the number of unique email addresses.
    *   Union operations: O(N * M * α(K)), where α(K) is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows extremely slowly and can be considered almost constant for practical input sizes.  The O(N*M) comes from iterating through the emails and the α(K) is the amortized time complexity of find and union in the DSU.
    *   Grouping emails by root: O(K).
    *   Sorting emails: O(K log K) in the worst case, where K is the number of unique email addresses.
    *   Overall:  O(N * M * α(K) + K log K).  Since α(K) is near constant, it is often simplified to O(N * M + K log K).  The dominating term is O(N*M) for large datasets.

*   **Space Complexity:**

    *   `emailToId`, `idToEmail`, `emailToName`: O(K), where K is the number of unique email addresses.
    *   DSU `parent` vector: O(K).
    *   `groups` map: O(K).
    *   `result` vector: O(N * M) in the worst case, where N is the number of accounts and M is the average number of emails per account.
    *   Overall: O(N * M + K).

**5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used**

*   **DSU Implementation:** The classic DSU implementation with path compression is a key pattern. Understanding and being able to implement DSU is vital for solving connectivity-related problems.
*   **Mapping to Integers for DSU:** The technique of mapping strings (email addresses) to integers before using the DSU is a common and efficient pattern for problems involving string-based relationships.
*   **Using `iota` for DSU Initialization:**  The use of `iota` to initialize the `parent` vector in the DSU is a concise way to set each element's parent to itself initially.
*   **Iterating using Range-based for loops:** The use of the range-based for loop improves the readability of the code.

**6. Edge Cases Handled**

*   **Duplicate Emails within an Account:** The code implicitly handles duplicate email addresses within a single account. The `unite` operation will only be performed once for each distinct email, even if it appears multiple times.
*   **Accounts with No Email Addresses (Only a Name):** While not explicitly handled with a conditional check, the code correctly processes accounts with only a name because the inner loop in the merge logic will not be executed if `acc.size()` is 1.
*   **Single Email Account:** The code works correctly when an account contains only one email. It is merged into its DSU group correctly.
*   **Empty Input:** The code can handle an empty input gracefully.
*   **Different order of emails in same account:** The DSU algorithm ensures that accounts that share emails are merged correctly regardless of the order in which emails are listed.
