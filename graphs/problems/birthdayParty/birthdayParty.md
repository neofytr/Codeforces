# Birthday Party Problem Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the C++ solution for the "Birthday Party" problem, accessible on Kattis at [https://open.kattis.com/problems/birthday](https://open.kattis.com/problems/birthday).

## 1. Problem Description (Inferred)

The problem asks whether a given graph is bi-connected. More specifically, given a graph with `p` people (nodes) and `c` friendships (edges), determine if there exists an edge such that removing it disconnects the graph. In other words, for each edge `(a, b)`, we need to check if removing that edge results in `a` and `b` being in separate connected components. If such an edge exists, the graph is *not* bi-connected, and the output should be "Yes". Otherwise, the graph *is* bi-connected, and the output should be "No". The input consists of multiple test cases, each defined by `p` and `c`, followed by `c` pairs of integers representing edges. The input ends when `p` is 0.

## 2. Approach Explanation

The solution iterates through each edge `(a, b)` in the graph and performs the following steps:

1.  Temporarily remove the edge `(a, b)` from consideration during a graph traversal.
2.  Start a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from node `a`.
3.  During the BFS, ensure that the edge `(a, b)` (and `(b, a)`) is not traversed. This effectively simulates the removal of the edge.
4.  After the BFS completes, check if node `b` was visited.
5.  If node `b` was *not* visited, it means removing the edge `(a, b)` disconnects the graph, and the output is "Yes". The process can terminate immediately in this case.
6.  If, after checking all edges, no edge was found that disconnects the graph, the output is "No".

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Bi-connectivity:** The core concept is understanding bi-connectivity, which means a graph remains connected even after removing any single edge.  This problem tests for bi-connectivity by checking if removing an edge disconnects the graph.
*   **Edge Iteration:** The solution iterates through each edge in the graph to check if removing it disconnects the graph. This brute-force approach is viable since the problem constraints are relatively small.
*   **BFS for Connectivity Check:** Breadth-First Search (BFS) is used to determine if two nodes are connected after the removal of an edge. BFS efficiently explores all reachable nodes from a starting node.
*   **Temporary Edge Removal:**  The critical technique is to simulate the removal of an edge during the BFS traversal. This is achieved by explicitly checking if the current edge being considered for traversal is the edge that is hypothetically removed, and skipping it if it is.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** The outer loop iterates `c` times (number of edges).  The BFS within the loop takes O(V+E) time in the worst case, where V is the number of vertices (`p`) and E is the number of edges (`c`). Since the BFS dominates the time complexity within the loop, the overall time complexity is O(c * (p + c)).
*   **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is dominated by the adjacency list representation of the graph, which takes O(p + c) space. The `vis` vector used during BFS takes O(p) space. The queue `que` can also hold up to O(p) elements in the worst case. Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(p + c).

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`#define int long long`:** Using `#define int long long` is a common practice in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow issues.
*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:** These lines are used to speed up input/output by disabling synchronization between C++ streams and C streams and unlinking `cin` from `cout`.
*   **`for (auto &[m, n] : edges)`:** The structured binding `auto &[m, n]` simplifies iteration over the vector of edges and allows direct access to the edge's endpoints by reference.
*   **Early Termination:** The `done` flag is set when a disconnecting edge is found, which allows the program to terminate early, improving efficiency.

## 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   **Multiple Test Cases:** The code handles multiple test cases within a `while` loop, exiting when `p` is 0.
*   **Empty Graph:** The code implicitly handles an empty graph.
*   **Disconnected Graph:** The algorithm is specifically designed to handle potentially disconnected graphs and identify edges whose removal further disconnects them.
*   **Self-loops and Multiple Edges:** While not explicitly handled, the solution would still work correctly if the graph contained self-loops or multiple edges because it examines each existing edge individually.
