## mooTube Analysis and Documentation

This document analyzes a C++ solution for the "mooTube" problem from USACO (United States Computing Olympiad), accessible at [https://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=788](https://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=788).

### 1. Problem Description (Inferred)

The mooTube problem involves a network of mooTube videos, where each video is a node in a graph.  Edges between videos represent their relatedness. Each edge has a *relevance* value associated with it. Given a source video and a minimum relevance value `k`, the task is to find the number of videos that are reachable from the source video such that the *minimum* relevance value along the path to that video is at least `k`.  The path from the source to any reachable video must only include edges with relevance values greater than or equal to `k`.

### 2. Approach Explanation

The solution utilizes a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the graph and determine the reachable videos that meet the relevance criteria.  For each query (k, src), the code performs the following:

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   A `vis` vector is used to track visited nodes, preventing cycles and redundant processing.
    *   A `que` (queue) is used to store nodes to visit, along with the minimum relevance encountered *so far* on the path from the source to that node.  Initially, the source node is added to the queue with a minimum relevance of `LLONG_MAX`.

2.  **BFS Traversal:**
    *   The algorithm iterates while the queue is not empty.
    *   It dequeues a node and its associated minimum relevance value.
    *   If the current node is *not* the source and the minimum relevance value from the source to this node is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments a counter `cnt`. This counter keeps track of the number of reachable videos meeting the criteria.
    *   For each neighbor of the current node, it checks the following:
        *   If the neighbor has not been visited.
        *   If the relevance value of the edge connecting the current node and the neighbor is greater than or equal to `k`.
        *   If both conditions are met, the neighbor is marked as visited, added to the queue, and the minimum relevance value is updated as `min(current_relevance, edge_relevance)`.

3.  **Output:**
    *   After the BFS traversal is complete, the value of `cnt` is printed, representing the number of reachable videos that satisfy the relevance condition.

### 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Graph Representation:** The graph is represented using an adjacency list, where `graph[i]` stores a vector of pairs, each representing a neighbor of node `i` and the relevance of the edge connecting them. This representation is efficient for sparse graphs (graphs with relatively few edges).

*   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores the graph layer by layer. It's suitable for finding the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) between two nodes.  In this problem, it is adapted to not find the shortest path necessarily, but to efficiently explore all reachable nodes that satisfy the relevance condition.

*   **Minimum Relevance Tracking:** The key to solving this problem efficiently is tracking the minimum relevance encountered along the path from the source to each reachable node. By storing the minimum relevance value along with the node in the queue, the algorithm can easily determine whether a node meets the relevance requirement without traversing the entire path from the source again.

*   **Visited Array:** The `vis` array is crucial to prevent cycles and ensure that each node is visited only once, optimizing the performance of the BFS.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   The graph is built in O(N) time.
    *   For each query, the BFS algorithm visits each node at most once and examines each edge at most once. Therefore, the time complexity of the BFS is O(N + E), where N is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges.  Since there are `queries` number of queries, the overall time complexity is O(N + Q * (N + E)).  In the worst case, E can be O(N^2), but in practice, for these kinds of problems it's often sparser, so often E = O(N). This makes the total time complexity often O(Q*N).

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   The adjacency list `graph` requires O(N + E) space.
    *   The `vis` array requires O(N) space.
    *   The `que` can potentially store all nodes in the worst case, requiring O(N) space.

    Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(N + E).

### 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`#define int long long`**:  This redefines the `int` data type to `long long`. This is a common practice in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow issues, especially when dealing with large numbers.  Remember to use `int32_t main()` instead of `int main()` after redefining `int`.
*   **`freopen("mootube.in", "r", stdin);` and `freopen("mootube.out", "w", stdout);`**:  This redirects standard input from "mootube.in" and standard output to "mootube.out". This is a standard requirement for USACO problems, where solutions are expected to read input from a file and write output to a file.
*   **Using `pair<int, int>` for edges:** Storing edges as pairs `<neighbor_node, relevance>` simplifies the traversal logic, as the neighbor and relevance are readily accessible.
*   **Starting BFS with maximum relevance**: Initiating the relevance from the source node as LLONG_MAX ensures that the first comparison in the queue will always consider the relevance of the outgoing edge.

### 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   **Source node itself not counted (correctly):** The code explicitly checks `if (x != src && d >= k)` before incrementing the count. This ensures that the source node is not included in the count, which is crucial because the problem asks for videos *reachable from* the source, implying not including the source itself unless a path with relevance >= k leads back to itself.
*   **Handling disconnected graphs:** The BFS will naturally only explore connected components reachable from the source node.  Nodes in other components will never be visited.
*   **Preventing Cycles (vis array):** The `vis` array is critical for preventing infinite loops in the graph traversal, which can occur in cyclic graphs. This avoids the algorithm exploring the same nodes repeatedly.
*   **Empty Graph:**  The code should theoretically work with an empty graph (n=0 or n=1 and no edges), as the loop will simply not execute.
