## Competitive Programming Solution Documentation: Codeforces Problem 1511C - Yet Another Card Deck

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the provided C++ code, which solves Codeforces problem 1511C, "Yet Another Card Deck" (https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1511/C).

### 1. Problem Description (Inferred)

We are given a deck of `n` cards, each with a color. Colors are numbered from 1 to 50.  We are then given `q` queries. Each query consists of a color `t`.  For each query, we need to:

1.  Print the index of the *first* occurrence of the color `t` in the deck (1-based indexing).
2.  Move the card of color `t` to the top of the deck. Specifically, all cards before `t` get shifted to the right (their indices incremented), and the card of color `t` becomes the first card (index 1).

### 2. Approach Explanation

The code uses a simple and efficient approach to track the positions of the first occurrence of each color.

1.  **`colorsToMinIndex` Array:** A vector `colorsToMinIndex` of size 51 (indexed from 1 to 50) stores the index of the *first* occurrence of each color in the deck. It's initialized with `LLONG_MAX` to ensure that the initial assignment of the first occurrence index works correctly.

2.  **Initialization:** The code iterates through the initial card deck, and for each color `a`, it updates `colorsToMinIndex[a]` with the *minimum* index at which that color appears.  This effectively stores the index of the first occurrence of each color.

3.  **Query Processing:** For each query color `t`:
    *   It retrieves the index of the first occurrence of color `t` from `colorsToMinIndex[t]`.
    *   It prints this index.
    *   It updates the `colorsToMinIndex` array to reflect the change in the deck's configuration. The key idea here is to iterate through all possible colors (1 to 50). If a color `c` is the color `t`, we set its index to 1 (since `t` is now at the top). If the first occurrence of `c` was *before* the first occurence of `t` in the *original* deck, we increment its index to reflect the shift caused by bringing `t` to the front.

### 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **First Occurrence Tracking:** The core idea is to efficiently track the first occurrence of each color using the `colorsToMinIndex` array. This avoids repeatedly searching the entire deck for each query.
*   **Efficient Updates:**  The code avoids actually manipulating the deck by instead modifying the `colorsToMinIndex` array. This simulates moving cards without requiring complex array or list operations.
*   **Space-Time Tradeoff:**  It uses extra space (`colorsToMinIndex`) to achieve faster query processing.
*   **Index Representation:** The `colorsToMinIndex` array stores 1-based indices to match the problem description.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   Initialization: O(n), where n is the number of cards in the deck.
    *   Query Processing: O(q * 50), where q is the number of queries.  For each query, the code iterates through all 50 possible colors to update their indices.  Since 50 is constant, this is effectively O(q).
    *   Overall: O(n + q).  The initialization takes O(n) time, and processing all q queries takes O(q) time assuming number of colors are capped at a constant.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(50) = O(1).  The `colorsToMinIndex` array has a fixed size of 51, independent of the input size `n` or `q`. The space usage can be considered constant.

### 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:** This optimization is used to speed up input/output operations in C++, by disabling synchronization between the C and C++ standard input/output streams.
*   **`#define int long long`:** This macro is used to redefine `int` as `long long`, preventing potential integer overflow issues, especially in problems involving larger numbers. Using `int32_t main()` is important to properly declare main when using this macro.
*   **Using `LLONG_MAX` for Initialization:**  Initializing `colorsToMinIndex` with `LLONG_MAX` provides a large initial value that's easily overwritten by the actual minimum indices.
*   **Implicit Deck Management:**  The program cleverly manages the "deck" *implicitly* by only updating the positions of the *first* occurrences of each color. This avoids costly swaps or shifts within a physical array.

### 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   **Empty Deck:** The code seems to assume there is a deck, i.e `n` > 0.  If `n` is 0, the `colorsToMinIndex` will remain at `LLONG_MAX` and the code might produce unexpected results. However, given the nature of competitive programming, it's often assumed that the problem constraints are satisfied. The constraints usually dictate that `n` > 0.
*   **Non-Existent Color in Deck:** If a query asks for a color `t` that doesn't exist in the initial deck, `colorsToMinIndex[t]` will remain at `LLONG_MAX`.  The code will still print `LLONG_MAX`, but then set its index to 1. Subsequent queries asking for a color that originally came before `t` will be affected by this move and could potentially be incorrect. The problem constraints must be read to understand if this is a possible scenario.
*   **Color exceeding 50:** The code is only handling colors from 1 to 50. If colors are larger than 50, the code may lead to errors because it causes access out of bounds in the vector `colorsToMinIndex`. Input validation would be necessary to ensure colors are within the correct range.

In summary, the solution is concise and efficient, cleverly manipulating the `colorsToMinIndex` array to simulate deck operations. It provides a good example of how to solve problems by focusing on the critical data structures to represent the problem and avoiding unnecessary operations on the simulated data.
