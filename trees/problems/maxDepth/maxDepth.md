# Documentation for Maximum Depth of Binary Tree Solution

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the provided C++ solution for finding the maximum depth of a binary tree.

## 1. Problem Description

The problem is to find the maximum depth of a binary tree. The maximum depth is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.  The problem is accessible on LeetCode: [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/).

## 2. Approach Explanation

The solution uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the binary tree level by level.  The core idea is:

1.  Start with the root node (if it exists) and add it to a queue.
2.  Iterate as long as the queue is not empty.
3.  In each iteration, process all nodes at the current level.
    *   Get the number of nodes at the current level.
    *   Iterate through all nodes at the current level, dequeuing each node.
    *   Enqueue the left and right children of each dequeued node (if they exist).
4.  Increment the `level` counter after processing each level.
5.  Finally, return the `level` which represents the maximum depth of the tree.

This approach efficiently explores the tree level by level, ensuring that the maximum depth is correctly calculated.

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** The core algorithm used is BFS, which is suitable for traversing a tree or graph level by level. BFS guarantees that nodes closer to the root are visited before nodes further away.  This is important because we are looking for the maximum depth.
*   **Level Tracking:** The solution keeps track of the current level being processed. This is crucial because the maximum depth is equal to the number of levels traversed.
*   **Queue Data Structure:** The queue is essential for implementing BFS. It maintains the order in which nodes are visited, ensuring that nodes at the same level are processed before moving to the next level.
*   **Level Size Determination:** The inner `while (size--)` loop is used to process all the nodes at a given level.  `size` is calculated *before* the inner loop to remember the number of nodes to be processed at that current level.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.  Each node is visited and processed exactly once.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(W), where W is the maximum width of the binary tree.  In the worst-case scenario (a complete binary tree), the width at the bottom level can be approximately N/2, so the space complexity can be considered O(N) in the worst case. The queue will store all nodes at the widest level of the tree.

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **Level-Order Traversal using Queue:** The standard BFS algorithm is implemented using a queue to ensure nodes at each level are processed together.
*   **Determining Level Size:** The size of the queue before entering the inner loop represents the number of nodes at the current level. Storing it allows for iterating through nodes at the current level without being affected by newly added children.

## 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   **Empty Tree:** The code handles the edge case of an empty tree (root is `nullptr`) correctly. The `if (root)` condition ensures that the queue is not populated with a null root, preventing a crash. If the tree is empty, the loop isn't entered and the `level` which is initialized to 0 is returned.
