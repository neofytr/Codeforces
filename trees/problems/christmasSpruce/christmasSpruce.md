# Codeforces Problem 913B: Christmas Spruce Analysis and Documentation

## 1. Problem Description (Inferred)

The problem, titled "Christmas Spruce" (available at [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/913/B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/913/B)), asks whether a given tree is a "Christmas Spruce". A tree is considered a Christmas Spruce if and only if every non-leaf node has at least 3 leaf nodes as its children.  The input describes a tree structure using parent-child relationships.  The root is implicitly node 1.

## 2. Approach Explanation

The solution employs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the tree level by level. For each non-leaf node encountered during the traversal, the algorithm counts the number of leaf node children. If any non-leaf node has fewer than 3 leaf node children, the tree is not a Christmas Spruce, and the algorithm reports "No". Otherwise, if the traversal completes without finding such a violation, the tree is a Christmas Spruce, and the algorithm reports "Yes".

The core logic is:

1. **Build the Tree:** Represent the tree using an adjacency list, where `tree[i]` stores a vector of the children of node `i`.
2. **BFS Traversal:** Perform a BFS starting from the root node (node 1).
3. **Leaf Node Check:** For each node visited, check if it's a non-leaf node.
4. **Count Leaf Children:** If it is a non-leaf node, count how many of its children are leaf nodes. A child is a leaf node if it has no children itself (i.e., `tree[v].empty()` is true for that child `v`).
5. **Spruce Condition Check:** If the number of leaf node children is less than 3, mark the tree as not being a Spruce and terminate (or in this implementation, continue checking).
6. **Output:** Print "Yes" if the entire tree is traversed without violating the condition; otherwise, print "No".

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**  BFS ensures that the tree is traversed level by level, which isn't strictly necessary for this problem, but it's a structured way to visit all nodes.  Depth-First Search (DFS) could also be used to solve this problem.
*   **Adjacency List Representation:** Representing the tree using an adjacency list (`vector<vector<int>> tree`) provides efficient access to the children of each node.
*   **Leaf Node Identification:** The code efficiently checks if a node is a leaf node by verifying if its corresponding vector in the adjacency list is empty (`tree[v].empty()`).
*   **Clear Boolean Flag:** Using a boolean variable (`isSpruce`) to track whether the tree satisfies the Spruce condition makes the code easy to understand.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.  This is because the BFS visits each node once, and for each node, the algorithm iterates through its children.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N), mainly due to the adjacency list (`tree`) used to represent the tree and the queue used in BFS. In the worst case, the queue can hold all nodes in a single level of the tree.

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:** This is a common optimization technique in C++ competitive programming to disable synchronization between the C and C++ standard input/output streams, which can significantly improve the program's input/output performance.
*   **`#define int long long`:** This redefines `int` to `long long`, effectively increasing the range of integer values that can be stored, and is frequently done when large integers might be involved to avoid potential integer overflow issues.
*   **Adjacency List:**  The use of `vector<vector<int>> tree` demonstrates a standard pattern for representing graphs and trees.

## 6. Any Edge Cases Handled

*   **Root Node:** The code correctly initializes the BFS queue with the root node (node 1).
*   **Leaf Nodes:** The code explicitly skips leaf nodes during the traversal, as the Spruce condition only applies to non-leaf nodes.
*   **Empty Tree (Implicit):** If the input consists of a single node (n=1), the tree trivially satisfies the condition and the BFS loop will not run since the tree[1] will remain empty.
