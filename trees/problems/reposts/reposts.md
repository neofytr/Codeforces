# Competitive Programming Solution Documentation: Codeforces Problem 522A - reposts

This document analyzes a C++ solution for the Codeforces problem 522A, "reposts".

## 1. Problem Description (Inferred)

Based on the code and comments, the problem "reposts" (available at [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/522/A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/522/A)) requires determining the maximum chain length in a reposting network.  The input consists of a number *n*, followed by *n* lines.  Each line represents a repost event in the form: `name1 repost name2`. This indicates that `name1` reposted something from `name2`. The goal is to find the longest chain of reposts starting from "polycarp".  Case-insensitive comparison should be used when comparing names.

## 2. Approach Explanation

The provided code simulates the repost chain.  It starts with "polycarp" as the initial source and iteratively processes each repost event.  For each event `name1 repost name2`, it checks if `name2` (case-insensitively) matches the last person in the current chain. If it matches, it means `name1` is the next person in the chain, and the chain length is incremented. The `last` variable is updated to `name1` to track the last person in the chain.  Finally, it prints the maximum chain length found.

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **String Comparison (Case-Insensitive):** The core algorithm relies on comparing strings while ignoring case. This is achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison using `tolower()`.
*   **Iterative Chain Tracking:** The solution iteratively builds the repost chain using a `while` loop and updates the `last` variable to track the most recent reposted user.
*   **Chain Length Calculation:** The `chainLen` variable keeps track of the length of the repost chain, and is incremented whenever a new repost event matches the expected pattern.
*   **String Comparison Optimization (Potentially):** There's a length check (`name2.size() != last.size()`) which acts as a potential optimization. If the sizes are different, the strings can't be equal after case conversion, avoiding the character-by-character comparison. However, its effectiveness depends on the input data.  If most `name2` entries happen to have the same length as `last`, this check is not very effective.
*   **Initialization:** Initialization is crucial. The problem specifies that the chain starts with "polycarp".

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** The code iterates through the input `n` times in the `while` loop. Inside the loop, the string comparison takes O(k) time in the worst case, where *k* is the maximum length of a name. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n*k).

*   **Space Complexity:** The code uses a few string variables (`name1`, `repost`, `name2`, `last`) and an integer `chainLen`. The space used by the strings depends on the input names, but is bounded by the maximum name length.  The space complexity is therefore O(k), where k is the maximum length of any input string.

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`**: This is a common optimization technique in C++ competitive programming to speed up input/output operations by disabling synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams.
*   **`#define int long long`**: This is a macro that redefines `int` as `long long`, which is often used to prevent integer overflow issues in competitive programming problems.
*   **`tolower()` for case-insensitive comparison:** Efficient way to do case-insensitive string comparison.
*   **Early Exit:** While not a crucial optimization, the code exits the character-by-character comparison as soon as a difference is found (`if (tolower(name2[r]) != tolower(last[r])) { isSame = false; break; }`).

## 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   **Incorrect Name Length:**  The code includes a length check `if (name2.size() != last.size()) continue;`. This skips processing events if the name lengths don't match, potentially improving efficiency, though its prime function is not correctness but speed.
*   **Case-Insensitive Comparison:** The use of `tolower()` handles names with different casing, as required by the problem.
*   **Starting Point:**  The code explicitly initializes `last` to "polycarp" to begin the chain correctly.
*   **Multiple reposts from the same person:** The code handles multiple reposts from the same person, because it updates `last` to the current person who reposted if the names are equal.
