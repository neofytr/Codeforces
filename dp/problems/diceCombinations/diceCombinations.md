## Dice Combinations Solution Analysis

This document analyzes a C++ solution for the "Dice Combinations" problem on CSES.fi (https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1633).

### 1. Problem Description (Inferred)

The "Dice Combinations" problem asks for the number of ways to construct a sum `n` by repeatedly rolling a standard six-sided die.  The order of the rolls matters, so the sequences (1, 2) and (2, 1) are considered distinct ways to form the sum 3. The answer should be returned modulo 10<sup>9</sup> + 7.

### 2. Approach Explanation

The solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of ways to reach each sum from 1 to `n`.  Specifically, it builds a sequence `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach the sum `i`.

The core idea is based on the observation that to reach a sum `r`, you can reach sums `r-1`, `r-2`, `r-3`, `r-4`, `r-5`, and `r-6` and then roll a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, respectively.  Therefore, `dp[r]` is the sum of `dp[r-1]`, `dp[r-2]`, ..., `dp[r-6]`.

The solution cleverly uses a `deque` to implement a sliding window of size 6.  Instead of storing the entire `dp` array, it maintains only the last 6 values needed to compute the next value. This drastically reduces the space complexity.

### 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Dynamic Programming:** The solution employs dynamic programming to break down the problem into smaller, overlapping subproblems. The result for `n` is built up from the results of smaller sums.
*   **Base Case:** The base case is `dp[0] = 1`.  There is one way to reach a sum of 0: by rolling no dice.
*   **Sliding Window Optimization:** The use of a `deque` implements a sliding window.  Only the last 6 values are kept in memory, as these are the only ones needed for the next calculation. This optimizes the space complexity.
*   **Modular Arithmetic:**  The results are computed modulo 10<sup>9</sup> + 7 (MOD) to prevent integer overflow, which is common in counting problems.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n). The outer loop iterates from 1 to `n`, and the inner loop iterates over the 6 elements of the `deque`, giving a constant factor.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The `deque` always holds a fixed number of elements (6), irrespective of the input `n`.

### 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **Deque as a Sliding Window:** Using a `deque` (double-ended queue) provides an efficient way to maintain a sliding window of fixed size.  `push_front()` adds an element to the beginning, and `pop_back()` removes an element from the end, effectively sliding the window.
*   **Modular Arithmetic:** Using the modulo operator `% MOD` in each addition step prevents integer overflow and ensures the answer remains within the required range.

### 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   **Base Case (n=0):**  The code correctly initializes `dp[0] = 1`, which is crucial for the recursion to work correctly. Although, the dp array is initialized in a weird way because it starts from negative indicies.
*   **Modular Arithmetic:**  The code uses modular arithmetic to handle the possibility of integer overflows. The modulo operation `% MOD` is applied after each addition to keep the intermediate results within the valid range.
