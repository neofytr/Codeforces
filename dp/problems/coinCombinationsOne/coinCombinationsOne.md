# Coin Combinations I Solution Documentation

This document provides a detailed analysis of the C++ solution for the "Coin Combinations I" problem on CSES (https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1635).

## 1. Problem Description

The "Coin Combinations I" problem asks us to find the number of distinct ordered tuples (permutations) of coins from a given set of coin values that sum up to a target amount `x`. We are given `n` distinct coin values and the target sum `x`.  The order of coins matters, meaning that `[1, 2]` and `[2, 1]` are considered different combinations.  The output should be the number of such combinations modulo 10^9 + 7.

## 2. Approach Explanation

The solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the number of combinations. The core idea is to build a `dp` array where `dp[i]` stores the number of distinct ways to form the sum `i` using the given coin denominations.

The `dp` array is populated iteratively.  For each sum `r` from 1 to `x`, we consider each coin denomination `c`. If `c` is less than or equal to `r`, it means we can potentially use coin `c` as the last coin in a combination that sums to `r`.  The number of ways to form the remaining sum `r - c` is already stored in `dp[r - c]`.  Therefore, we add `dp[r - c]` to `dp[r]`.  This process is repeated for all coins `c`.

The initial condition is handled implicitly: `dp[0]` is conceptually considered to be 1 (there's one way to form a sum of 0: using no coins), although it's not explicitly initialized as such. The solution seeds the initial values by iterating through coins and setting `dp[c]++` if `c <= x` effectively covering cases where a single coin can directly make the sum.

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Dynamic Programming:** The problem exhibits optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, making it suitable for dynamic programming. The number of ways to reach a sum `r` depends on the number of ways to reach smaller sums `r - c`, where `c` is a coin value.
*   **Bottom-Up Approach:** The dynamic programming solution uses a bottom-up approach, calculating the number of combinations for smaller sums before larger sums. This ensures that `dp[r - c]` is already computed when calculating `dp[r]`.
*   **Order Matters (Permutations):**  The problem specifically asks for permutations, which means the order of coins matters.  The outer loop iterates through possible sums `r`, and the inner loop iterates through coin denominations `c`. This order allows us to build combinations in different orders, counting each order as a distinct combination.
*   **Modulo Arithmetic:** Since the number of combinations can be very large, the solution uses modulo arithmetic (`% MOD`, where `MOD = 10^9 + 7`) to prevent integer overflow.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** The outer loop iterates from 1 to `x` (target sum), and the inner loop iterates through the `n` coins.  Therefore, the time complexity is O(n * x).
*   **Space Complexity:** The solution uses a `dp` array of size `x + 1` to store the number of combinations for each sum from 0 to `x`.  Therefore, the space complexity is O(x).

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:** This optimization disables synchronization between C++ standard streams and the C standard streams, and unties `cin` from `cout`, which can significantly improve input/output performance, especially in competitive programming.
*   **`#define int long long`:** This preprocessor directive redefines `int` as `long long`, preventing integer overflow issues that may arise with larger input values. Be mindful of cases where you might expect `int` behaviour specifically (e.g., size of STL containers, etc.).
*   **`vector<int> dp(x + 1, 0);`:**  This initializes a vector of size `x + 1` with all elements set to 0. This is important for ensuring correctness because you are incrementing `dp[r]` within the inner loop.
*   **`dp[r] = (dp[r] + dp[r - c]) % MOD;`:** This ensures that the number of ways to form sum `r` is updated correctly and that the modulo operation is performed to prevent overflow.

## 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   **`if (c <= r)`:** This condition ensures that we only consider coins that are less than or equal to the current sum `r`. This avoids accessing negative indices in the `dp` array (e.g., `dp[r - c]` when `c > r`).
*   **Modulo Arithmetic:** Handling of large numbers via modulo operation is critical for avoiding overflow and getting a correct answer.  The problem explicitly requires the output modulo 10^9 + 7.
*   The implicit initialization where `dp[c]` is incremented at the start handles cases where a single coin `c` can directly form the sum `x` when `c == x`. This ensures `dp[x]` is properly initialized if `x` happens to be a valid coin.

int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    // consider a money system consisting of n coins
    // each coin has a positive integer value
    // our task is to calculate the number of distinct ways (permutations) we can produce a money sum x using the available coins
    // i.e, we want to calculate the number of different ordered tuples (c1, c2, ..., ci) where ck is from Coins
    // for any i >= 1 such that c1 + ... + ci = x

    int n, x;
    cin >> n >> x;

    vector<int> coins(n);
    for (int &val : coins)

    vector<int> dp(x + 1, 0);
    for (const int c : coins)
        if (c <= x)
            dp[c]++;

    for (int r = 1; r <= x; r++) {
        // to make the sum r, we decide on the last coin used
        // for any c <= r, if we decide c to use as the last coin
        // then, we will have an additional dp[r - c] ways to make r
        // so,
        // dp[r] = (summation over all coins c such that c <= r) dp[r - c]

        for (const int c : coins)
            if (c <= r)
                dp[r] = (dp[r] + dp[r - c]) % MOD;
    }

    cout << dp[x] << endl;
    return 0;
}
