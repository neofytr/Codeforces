# Documentation: Interesting Drink (Codeforces 706B)

This document provides a detailed analysis of the competitive programming solution for the "Interesting Drink" problem on Codeforces (https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/706/B).

## 1. Problem Description

A shop sells *n* different types of drinks, each with a specific price.  You are given an array `price` of length *n*, where `price[i]` is the price of the *i*-th drink.  Then, you are given *q* queries.  For each query *m*, you need to find the number of drinks that you can buy with *m* money (i.e., the number of drinks whose price is less than or equal to *m*).

## 2. Approach Explanation

The core idea is to efficiently determine the number of drinks affordable for each query *m*.  A naive solution of iterating through the `price` array for each query would result in a time complexity of O(n*q), which could be too slow for larger inputs.

A more efficient approach involves these steps:

1.  **Sort the `price` array:** This allows us to use binary search to find the upper bound of prices less than or equal to *m*.
2.  **For each query *m*:**
    *   Perform a binary search on the sorted `price` array to find the index of the last element that is less than or equal to *m*.  This index represents the number of affordable drinks.
    *   The number of affordable drinks is then this index + 1.

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Binary Search:** The most important technique used here is binary search. Binary search is applicable because the `price` array is sorted.  It allows us to efficiently find the index of the last element that is less than or equal to *m* in logarithmic time, O(log n).
*   **Sorting:** Sorting the `price` array is crucial for enabling binary search. The `std::sort` function provides an efficient way to sort the array in O(n log n) time.
*   **Lower Bound (Implicit):** While the code doesn't explicitly use `std::lower_bound` or `std::upper_bound`, the implemented binary search essentially performs an upper bound search, or a modified search to find the last index that is less than or equal to *m*. The standard library functions would provide a more concise implementation, but the given code demonstrates a clear manual implementation.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   Sorting: O(n log n)
    *   For each query: O(log n)
    *   Total for queries: O(q log n)
    *   Overall: O(n log n + q log n)

    If *q* is significantly larger than *n*, then the time complexity is dominated by the query processing.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(n) -  primarily for storing the `price` array. The binary search uses a constant amount of extra space.

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **Binary Search Implementation:** The custom binary search implementation correctly handles the boundary conditions. `left` is initialized to -1 and `right` to `n`. The condition `right != left + 1` ensures that the search continues until `left` and `right` are adjacent.  The updates to `left` and `right` (`right = mid` and `left = mid`) maintain the invariant that `price[left] <= m` and `price[right] > m`.
*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:** This is a standard optimization technique used in competitive programming to speed up input/output operations by disabling synchronization between C++ streams and the C standard input/output library.
*   **`#define int long long`:**  This redefines `int` as `long long`.  This is done to prevent integer overflow issues, particularly when dealing with large numbers in calculations.  It's a common practice to avoid potential runtime errors.
*   **Range based for loop for input:** `for (int &val : price) cin >> val;` provides a concise way to read in the input.

## 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   **Empty `price` array (n = 0):** The code implicitly handles the case where `n = 0`.  In this situation, the binary search will return -1, and the output will be `left + 1 = 0`. This is the correct behavior because no drinks are affordable.
*   **All drinks are affordable:** If all prices are less than or equal to *m*, the binary search will find the last element, and `left` will be `n - 1`.  The output will be `left + 1 = n`, which is correct.
*   **No drinks are affordable:** If all prices are greater than *m*, the binary search will terminate with `left = -1`. The output will be `left + 1 = 0`, which is correct.
*   **Duplicate prices:** The binary search works correctly even if there are duplicate prices in the `price` array. It finds the index of the *last* occurrence of a price less than or equal to *m*, which is the desired behavior.
