## Documentation for Coin Combinations II Problem

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the C++ solution for the "Coin Combinations II" problem found on CSES (https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1636).

### 1. Problem Description

The "Coin Combinations II" problem on CSES asks us to find the number of *distinct* ways to form a target sum `x` using `n` given coins. Each coin has a positive integer value. The key constraint is that the order of the coins doesn't matter; we are counting combinations, not permutations. For example, if `x = 4` and coins are `[1, 2]`, the valid combinations are `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 2]`, and `[2, 2]`. The combination `[2, 1, 1]` is considered the same as `[1, 1, 2]`.

### 2. Approach Explanation

The provided code utilizes dynamic programming to solve the problem.  The core idea is to build a 2D table `dp`, where `dp[r][k]` represents the number of distinct ways to form the sum `r` using only the first `k+1` coins (coins at indices 0 to `k` in the `coins` array).

The DP relation is based on two possibilities:

1.  **Include the `k`-th coin:** If the target sum `r` is greater than or equal to the value of the `k`-th coin (`coins[k]`), we can include it.  The number of ways to form the sum `r` in this case is the same as the number of ways to form the sum `r - coins[k]` using the *same set of coins* (0 to `k`).  This is because we can reuse the coin as many times as we want. So the number of ways is `dp[r - coins[k]][k]`.

2.  **Exclude the `k`-th coin:** If we don't include the `k`-th coin, the number of ways to form the sum `r` is the same as the number of ways to form the sum `r` using only the first `k` coins (0 to `k-1`). So the number of ways is `dp[r][k - 1]`.

Therefore, the main DP relation is:

`dp[r][k] = dp[r - coins[k]][k] + dp[r][k - 1]`  (if `r >= coins[k]`)
`dp[r][k] = dp[r][k - 1]`                 (otherwise)

The base cases are:

*   `dp[0][k] = 1` for all `k`: There's always one way to form a sum of 0 (by not choosing any coins).
*   `dp[r][0] = 1` if `r` is a multiple of `coins[0]`, and `0` otherwise:  If we only have the first coin, we can only form sums that are multiples of its value.

Finally, the answer is stored in `dp[x][n - 1]`, which represents the number of distinct ways to form the sum `x` using all `n` coins.

### 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Dynamic Programming:**  The core technique is dynamic programming, specifically using a 2D table to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations. The problem exhibits optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, making it well-suited for DP.
*   **Combinations vs. Permutations:** The problem emphasizes *distinct* combinations.  The order of the coins doesn't matter.  The key to handling this is to build up the solution incrementally, considering coins one at a time, and allowing each coin to be used as many times as necessary *before* moving on to the next coin.  This ensures we only count each combination once. The standard permutation-based coin change problem would not include `dp[r - coins[k]][k]` but instead `dp[r - coins[k]][k - 1]`.
*   **Bottom-Up Approach:** The DP table is filled in a bottom-up manner, starting with the base cases and iteratively building up to the final solution.
*   **Modulo Arithmetic:** The problem likely involves large numbers of combinations, so the result is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` (`MOD`) to prevent integer overflow.  However, the code snippet doesn't include modulo operation in calculating the dp values, which can be a potential issue. (See the comment below about a potential fix).

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n * x), where `n` is the number of coins and `x` is the target sum. This is because we iterate through all `n` coins and all possible sums from 0 to `x`.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n * x), due to the `dp` table of size `(x + 1) * n`.

### 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(nullptr);`:** These lines are used to optimize input/output operations in C++, making the code run faster, especially when dealing with large inputs.
*   **`#define int long long`:** This preprocessor directive changes the default `int` type to `long long`, which is necessary to handle larger sums and avoid potential integer overflows.
*   **Zero Initialization:** The `dp` vector is initialized with zeros.
*   **Concise Base Case Handling:** The code effectively handles base cases, ensuring correctness for the initial stages of the DP calculation.

### 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   **Sum of 0:** The base case `dp[0][k] = 1` correctly handles the case where the target sum is 0.
*   **Using only the first coin:** The `dp[r][0]` initialization correctly handles the sums that can be formed using only the first coin.

### Potential Improvements and Considerations:

*   **Modulo Arithmetic:** The `dp` values should be taken modulo `MOD` after each addition to prevent integer overflow.  The line `dp[r][k] = (r >= coins[k] ? dp[r - coins[k]][k] : 0) + dp[r][k - 1];` should be modified to:

    ```c++
    dp[r][k] = ((r >= coins[k] ? dp[r - coins[k]][k] : 0) + dp[r][k - 1]) % MOD;
    ```

*   **Space Optimization:**  The space complexity can be reduced to O(x) by using only a 1D DP array.  Since `dp[r][k]` only depends on `dp[r][k-1]` and `dp[r - coins[k]][k]`, we can update the DP table in place, iterating through coins first and then through the possible sums. This makes the current implementation only use values in the current row and in the row above, allowing us to use only one row.

    ```c++
    vector<int> dp(x + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (int coin : coins) {
        for (int r = coin; r <= x; r++) {
            dp[r] = (dp[r] + dp[r - coin]) % MOD;
        }
    }
    cout << dp[x] << endl;
    ```
    This space-optimized version often has a slightly better runtime as well.
*   **Input Validation:**  Although not explicitly handled, it's good practice to validate the input (e.g., check if `n` and `x` are within reasonable bounds, and if the coin values are positive).

By addressing these potential improvements and considering the insights discussed above, one can create an even more robust and efficient solution to the "Coin Combinations II" problem.

## Original Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define int long long

// Problem: coinCombinationsTwo
// URL: https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1636
// Difficulty: hard

#define MOD (int)(1e9 + 7)

int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int n, x;
    cin >> n >> x;

    vector<int> coins(n);
    for (int &val : coins)
        cin >> val;

    // consider a money system consisting of n coins
    // each coin has a positive integer value
    // our task if to calculate the number of distinct ways we can produce a money sum x using the available coins

    // dp[r][k] is the number of distinct ways we can produce a money sum r using the coins in the index range [0, k]
    vector<vector<int>> dp(x + 1, vector<int>(n, 0));

    // so, to construct the money sum r using coins [0, k]
    // we can either pick the coin k and construct the sum r - k (if r >= k) from the coins [0, k]
    // or we don't pick the coin and construct the sum from the coins [0, k - 1]
    // dp[r][k] = dp[r - k][k] + dp[r][k - 1]

    // base cases ->
    // we need dp[0][...] and dp[...][0]

    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++)
        dp[0][k] = 1; // there is exactly one way to make the sum 0
    for (int r = 0; r <= x; r++)
        dp[r][0] = (!(r % coins[0]) ? 1 : 0); // if we can make r using some number of coins[0], we put it to one

    for (int r = 1; r <= x; r++)
        for (int k = 1; k < n; k++)
            dp[r][k] = (r >= coins[k] ? dp[r - coins[k]][k] : 0) + dp[r][k - 1];

    cout << dp[x][n - 1] << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
