# Coin Combinations II Solution Analysis

This document analyzes a C++ solution for the "Coin Combinations II" problem on CSES (https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1636).

## 1. Problem Description

The "Coin Combinations II" problem asks us to find the number of distinct ways to form a target sum `x` using a given set of `n` distinct coin values. The order of the coins used in a combination does not matter, meaning [1, 2] and [2, 1] are considered the same combination if using coins with value 1 and 2.  The answer needs to be calculated modulo 10<sup>9</sup> + 7.

## 2. Approach Explanation

The solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The core idea is to build up the possible sums incrementally, considering each coin one at a time.  Specifically, the code calculates `dp[i]`, the number of distinct ways to form the sum `i` using the coins that have been processed so far.

The critical point is the order in which the iterations are performed. The outer loop iterates through the coins, and the inner loop iterates through the possible sums from the current coin's value up to the target sum `x`. This order ensures that we only count each combination once, preventing overcounting due to different permutations of the same coins.

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Dynamic Programming:** The problem exhibits optimal substructure (the number of ways to form a sum can be derived from the number of ways to form smaller sums) and overlapping subproblems (the same sums are needed to compute multiple larger sums), making dynamic programming a suitable approach.
*   **Iterative DP:** The code implements the dynamic programming solution iteratively, which is generally more efficient than a recursive approach for this kind of problem.
*   **Coin-by-Coin Iteration:** The key insight lies in iterating through the coins in the outer loop. This structure guarantees that we're only adding each coin's value to the sum once, preventing overcounting due to reordering of the coins.  If the sum iteration were outer and the coin iteration inner, the ordering *would* matter, and the solution would be incorrect.
*   **Modulo Arithmetic:** Since the number of combinations can be very large, the solution uses modulo arithmetic (`MOD = 1e9 + 7`) to prevent integer overflow.  The modulo operation is applied after each addition to keep the values within the valid range.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n * x), where `n` is the number of coins and `x` is the target sum. The outer loop iterates `n` times, and the inner loop iterates up to `x` times.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(x), where `x` is the target sum.  The `dp` vector of size `x + 1` stores the number of ways to form each sum from 0 to `x`.

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(nullptr);`:** These lines are commonly used in competitive programming to speed up input/output operations by disabling synchronization between the C++ standard streams and the C standard streams.
*   **Fast Modulo:** The code uses `if (dp[r] >= MOD) dp[r] -= MOD;` as a slightly optimized way to perform the modulo operation.  It's equivalent to `dp[r] %= MOD`, but potentially faster because it avoids the division operation inherent in the modulo operator when the value is only slightly greater than the modulus.
*   **Range-Based For Loop:** The code uses range-based for loops (e.g., `for (const int c : coins)`) to iterate through the elements of the `coins` vector, making the code more concise and readable.

## 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   **`dp[0] = 1;`:**  This initialization handles the base case where the target sum is 0. There is one way to form a sum of 0, which is to use no coins at all.
*   **No Coins:** The solution gracefully handles the case where `n` is 0. In this situation, there's likely no way to create any sum `x` if `x > 0`, and `dp[0]` remains 1.
*   **`r >= c`:** The inner loop starts from `c` because you can't use a coin of value `c` to form any value less than `c`. This is implicit and ensures that the program doesn't access an invalid array index `dp[r - c]` when `r < c`.

#define MOD (int)(1e9 + 7)

int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int n, x;
    cin >> n >> x;

    vector<int> coins(n);
    for (int &val : coins)
        cin >> val;

    // consider a money system consisting of n coins
    // each coin has a positive integer value
    // our task if to calculate the number of distinct ways we can produce a money sum x using the available coins

    // dp[r] = number of distinct ways to form sum r using the coins we've processed so far
    vector<int> dp(x + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (const int c : coins)
        for (int r = c; r <= x; r++) {
            // since we can't form anything less than c with a coin = c
            dp[r] += dp[r - c]; // we add the coin c to the distinct ways of making sum = r - c
            // this won't overcount since this is the first time we're using c to build the sum r
            // also, since we count up (from r = c to x), we can reuse the coins
            if (dp[r] >= MOD)
                dp[r] -= MOD; // fast modulo
        }

    /*
     * Go coin by coin; for each sum s, add all ways to make s - c using coins seen so far.
     * Because coins are outer, orders donâ€™t multiply; because s goes up, you can reuse the same coin many times.
     */
    cout << dp[x] << endl;
    return 0;
}
