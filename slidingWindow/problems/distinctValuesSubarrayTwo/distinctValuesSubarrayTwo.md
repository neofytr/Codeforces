# Distinct Values Subarray II Solution Analysis

This document analyzes a C++ solution for the "Distinct Values Subarray II" problem, available at [CSES Problem Set Task 2428](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2428).

## 1. Problem Description (Inferred)

The problem asks to find the number of subarrays of a given array that contain at most *k* distinct values.

**Input:**

*   *n*: The size of the array.
*   *k*: The maximum number of distinct values allowed in a subarray.
*   `arr`: An array of *n* integers.

**Output:**

The number of subarrays of `arr` that contain at most *k* distinct values.

## 2. Approach Explanation

The solution uses a sliding window approach to solve this problem efficiently. The core idea is to maintain a window `[l, r]` and expand the window's right boundary `r`. While expanding, it tracks the number of distinct elements in the window using a `std::unordered_map` (`mp`) and a `std::set` (`s`).  If the number of distinct elements exceeds *k*, the left boundary `l` is advanced until the condition `s.size() <= k` is met again. The number of valid subarrays ending at index `r` is then calculated as `r - l + 1`, and this value is accumulated into the `num` variable, which stores the total count of valid subarrays.

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Sliding Window:** This is the primary technique. The window `[l, r]` slides across the array. The advantage is that instead of recalculating distinct elements for each subarray, the algorithm maintains a count and updates it efficiently.
*   **Frequency Map (`unordered_map`):** The `mp` unordered map stores the frequency of each element within the current window.  This allows for efficient tracking of the number of occurrences of each value.
*   **Distinct Element Tracking (`set`):** The `s` set stores the distinct elements present in the current window. Sets provide efficient uniqueness and size tracking, crucial for determining if the current window satisfies the distinct value constraint.
*   **Two Pointers:** The `l` and `r` variables act as two pointers that define the sliding window's boundaries.
*   **Accumulative Counting:** The solution uses an accumulative counting technique where, for each `r`, all subarrays ending at `r` that meet the criteria `s.size() <= k` are counted. Since the elements from `l` to `r` meet the criteria, there are `r-l+1` subarrays that need to be counted.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity: O(n)** - The `l` and `r` pointers each iterate through the array at most once. The operations inside the `while` loop and the main loop (`mp` access, `set` insertion/deletion) are amortized O(1) on average, due to the use of `unordered_map` and `set`. The `custom_hash` function also takes constant time.
*   **Space Complexity: O(n)** - In the worst case, the `unordered_map` and `set` can store all distinct elements of the input array. Thus, in the worst case, it can store all n elements.

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **Custom Hash Function:**  The `custom_hash` struct is used to provide a custom hash function for the `unordered_map`. This can help improve performance by reducing hash collisions, especially when dealing with integer keys. The `splitmix64` function is a fast and well-distributed hash function.  Using a fixed random value seeded by `std::chrono::steady_clock::now()` helps reduce the chance of denial-of-service attacks that rely on predictable hash functions.
*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:** This optimization disables synchronization between C++ streams and the C standard input/output library and prevents the tie between `cin` and `cout`, leading to faster input/output operations. This is commonly used in competitive programming.
*   **`int32_t main()` vs. `int main()` and `#define int long long`:** The `int32_t main()` function coupled with the `#define int long long` preprocessor directive effectively redefines the `int` type as `long long` throughout the code. This is done to avoid integer overflow issues when dealing with larger numbers and constraints often found in competitive programming problems.

## 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   **Empty Subarray:** The code implicitly handles cases where *k* is 0, resulting in zero if the array contains any distinct numbers.
*   **k >= number of distinct elements:** If *k* is greater than or equal to the total number of distinct elements in the entire array, the solution correctly counts all possible subarrays.
*   **`l <= r` check:** The condition `if (r >= l)` ensures that `num` is only incremented when a valid non-empty subarray `[l, r]` exists. If the window becomes empty (due to `l` surpassing `r`), it will not add anything to the count.

## 7. Summary

This solution provides an efficient and concise way to count the number of subarrays with at most *k* distinct values. It effectively utilizes the sliding window technique along with appropriate data structures (unordered\_map and set) and input/output optimization to achieve optimal performance. The custom hash function improves the robustness of the solution and decreases the possibility of hash collisions.
