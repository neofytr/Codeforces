# ROPE CUTTING PROBLEM USING BINARY SEARCH 

---

## Problem Statement

- You are given `n` ropes, with lengths `a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ`.
- You must cut exactly `k` pieces **of the same length**.
- Find the **maximum possible length** of each piece.

---

## Modeling the Problem

We model the problem using a **predicate function** `isGood(x)`:

- `isGood(x)` returns `true` if we can cut at least `k` pieces of length `x`.
- Otherwise, it returns `false`.

**Key property**:  
The function `isGood(x)` is **monotonic**:

- If `isGood(x)` is true, then `isGood(y)` is true for all `y ≤ x`.
- If `isGood(x)` is false, then `isGood(y)` is false for all `y ≥ x`.

This **monotonicity** allows us to apply **binary search** to find the maximum value of `x` for which `isGood(x)` is still true.

## Binary Search Approach

1. **Initialization**:
    - Left boundary (`left`) = 0 (smallest possible length).
    - Right boundary (`right`) = maximum rope length among all ropes.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
    - Compute `mid = (left + right) / 2`.
    - If `isGood(mid)` is true:
        - Move `left = mid` (try for larger lengths).
    - Otherwise:
        - Move `right = mid` (try for smaller lengths).

3. **Termination Condition**:
    - Since real numbers don't have "adjacent values," we cannot stop when `left + 1 == right` like integers.
    - We stop when the interval becomes smaller than a threshold `eps`:
      ```
      while (right - left > eps)
      ```
    - Alternatively, **fixed number of iterations** (e.g., 100) guarantees termination.

4. **Output**:
    - After binary search, `left` contains the maximum length with required precision.

## Floating-Point Precision Issues

### Why Precision Problems Occur

- Computers represent real numbers using **floating-point numbers** (like `double`).
- Floating points have **limited precision**:
    - Only about **15-17 significant digits** are stored.
- As a result:
    - Some numbers are rounded.
    - Small differences may disappear.
    - `(left + right)/2` can become exactly `left` or `right` if they are very close.
    - Binary search can **get stuck** in an infinite loop if not careful.

### How to Solve Floating-Point Issues

- **Use precision threshold** (`eps`), e.g., `eps = 1e-7`.
- **Use a fixed number of iterations**, e.g., 100 steps.
- **Never compare floating-point numbers** using `==`.
    - Instead, compare if `abs(a - b) < eps`.
- **Use `left + (right - left) / 2`** instead of `(left + right) / 2` to avoid overflow.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- Each iteration of binary search halves the interval.
- The number of iterations needed is proportional to:
  ```
  log₂((initial right - initial left) / eps)
  ```
- For each iteration:
    - We call `isGood(x)`, which checks all `n` ropes.
    - `isGood(x)` runs in **O(n)**.

Thus, the total time complexity is:

\[
O(n \times \log_2(\text{maxRope} / \text{eps}))
\]

Where:
- `n` = number of ropes
- `maxRope` = maximum rope length
- `eps` = desired precision

---

### Space Complexity

- Only storing the ropes array: **O(n)** space.
- No additional significant memory usage.

---

## Maximum Number of Iterations

Given the nature of binary search:

- Every iteration cuts the search interval by **half**.
- After `k` iterations, the interval length becomes:

\[
\text{initial length} \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k
\]

To achieve an interval smaller than `eps`, we solve:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k < \frac{\text{eps}}{\text{initial length}}
\]

Taking log base 2:

\[
k > \log_2\left(\frac{\text{initial length}}{\text{eps}}\right)
\]

**Example**:
- If initial length = 10⁴ (say rope lengths are up to 10⁴)
- eps = 10⁻⁶

Then:

\[
k > \log_2(10^{10}) \approx 33
\]

Thus, **about 33–40 iterations** are **theoretical maximum**.  
**Using 100 iterations** is **safe and very sufficient**.

---

## Alternative Stopping Conditions

1. **Fixed iteration count** (recommended in contests):
    - Run binary search for, say, 100 iterations.
    - Guarantees termination even if floating-point issues arise.

2. **Precision-based stopping**:
    - Continue binary search until `right - left < eps`.

Both are valid, but **fixed iterations** are more robust in practice.

## Practical Tips for Competitive Programming

- Always test edge cases:
    - Single rope
    - Very large/small rope lengths
    - Very high number of pieces needed

- Debugging binary search:
    - Print `left`, `right`, and `mid` values during development.

- If facing infinite loops:
    - Check floating-point precision
    - Check if your termination condition is correct

- Set `eps` wisely:
    - 1e-6 or 1e-7 is usually enough unless stated otherwise.

- Use `fixed` and `setprecision` when outputting floating points.

---

## Common Errors and Pitfalls

- **Using exact equality** on floats (never do this).
- **Not narrowing the search space properly** (wrong updates to left/right).
- **Too high precision causing long runtime**.
- **Forgetting to return/print with the required decimal places**.

---

## Binary Search Patterns Overview

- **Classic binary search**:
    - Search for a value in a sorted array.

- **First/last occurrence**:
    - Search for the boundary (lower/upper bound) in sorted arrays.

- **Binary search on answer**:
    - Search over possible values (even real numbers) where answers are monotonic.
    - This problem (rope cutting) is a binary search on real numbers.

---

## Summary

- **Binary search** applies when the function has a **monotonic true/false behavior**.
- For **real numbers**, always handle **precision carefully**.
- Use **fixed iterations** or **precision checks** to terminate safely.
- Understand **floating-point rounding errors** to avoid subtle bugs.
- Know the **complexity**:
    - Time: \( O(n \log(\text{range} / \text{precision})) \)
    - Space: \( O(n) \)
