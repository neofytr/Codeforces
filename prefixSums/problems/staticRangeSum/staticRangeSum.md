# Static Range Sum Queries Solution Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the provided C++ code, which solves the "Static Range Sum Queries" problem.

## 1. Problem Description

The problem, available at [https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1646](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1646), asks to process a series of range sum queries on a static array.  Specifically, given an array of *n* integers and *q* queries, each query consists of two indices, *a* and *b* (1-indexed), and the task is to compute the sum of the elements in the array from index *a* to *b* (inclusive).

## 2. Approach Explanation

The solution utilizes the prefix sum technique to efficiently answer the range sum queries. The core idea is to precompute the cumulative sum of the array elements and store them in a `prefix` array.  Then, for each query, the sum of elements within a given range can be calculated in O(1) time by subtracting the prefix sum at the start of the range from the prefix sum at the end of the range (plus one).

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Prefix Sum Technique:** This is the core algorithmic technique.  The prefix sum array `prefix` is built such that `prefix[i]` stores the sum of elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]`.  This allows calculating the sum of elements in a range [a, b] as `prefix[b+1] - prefix[a]`.
*   **1-based Indexing (Prefix Sum):** The prefix sum array `prefix` is of size `n+1`. `prefix[0]` is initialized to 0, representing the sum of no elements. This simplifies the range sum calculation.
*   **Range Query Processing:** Using the precomputed prefix sums, each range sum query can be answered in constant time.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   Preprocessing (building the prefix sum array): O(n)
    *   Query processing: O(1) per query
    *   Total time complexity: O(n + q), where *n* is the size of the array and *q* is the number of queries.
*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   The solution uses an array `arr` of size *n* to store the input array and a `prefix` array of size *n+1* to store the prefix sums. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`**: This optimization disables synchronization between C and C++ standard streams and unties `cin` from `cout`, which significantly improves the input/output performance, especially important for competitive programming problems.
*   **`#define int long long`**:  This macro redefines `int` as `long long`. This is a common practice to avoid integer overflow issues when dealing with large sums or products.
*   **1-based prefix sum array:** The `prefix` array starts from index 1 to represent sums, where index 0 represents an empty range sum of zero. This simplifies the range sum calculation logic. The code handles the conversion from 1-indexed query inputs to 0-indexed array access internally, ensuring correct calculations.

## 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   **Zero-length range:** The algorithm handles cases where `a == b` correctly, as it computes `prefix[b+1] - prefix[a]`, which results in `arr[a]` if `a` and `b` are the same after zero-indexing in the main loop.
*   **General range [a, b]:** The prefix sum technique correctly handles all valid ranges [a, b] where 1 <= a <= b <= n because of the prefix sum calculation `prefix[index] = prefix[index - 1] + arr[index - 1];`.
*   **Integer Overflow:** The use of `long long` for `int` prevents potential integer overflow issues when calculating the sums of potentially large integers.
