# Competitive Programming Solution Documentation: Karen and Coffee

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of a C++ solution for the "Karen and Coffee" problem found on Codeforces (Problem B in Contest 816: [https://codeforces.com/contest/816/problem/B](https://codeforces.com/contest/816/problem/B)).

## 1. Problem Description

Karen loves coffee, and she wants to find the perfect temperature range to brew it. Given `n` temperature ranges (inclusive), each defined by a lower bound `l_i` and an upper bound `r_i`, and a threshold `k`, we need to determine the number of temperatures within a query range `[l, r]` that are present in at least `k` of the given temperature ranges.  We are given `q` such queries. All temperatures are integers.

## 2. Approach Explanation

The solution uses the following approach:

1.  **Difference Array (Updates):** A difference array (`update`) is used to efficiently represent the number of times each temperature is within the given ranges.  For each range `[l, r]`, we increment `update[l]` and decrement `update[r+1]`.
2.  **Prefix Sum (Cumulative Sum):** A prefix sum is calculated on the `update` array to obtain the actual count of ranges covering each temperature. `update[i]` then represents the number of ranges containing the temperature `i`.
3.  **Prefix Sum (Counting qualified temperatures):**  Another prefix sum array (`prefix`) is created to store the cumulative count of temperatures that appear in at least `k` ranges.  `prefix[i]` represents the number of temperatures from 0 up to (but not including) `i` which are within at least `k` ranges.
4.  **Query Processing:** For each query `[l, r]`, the answer is calculated as `prefix[r + 1] - prefix[l]`. This gives the number of temperatures within the range `[l, r]` (inclusive) that meet the condition of being present in at least `k` of the initial temperature ranges.  We subtract 1 from l and r to match the 0-based indexing.

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Difference Array:**  This technique is crucial for efficiently handling multiple range updates. Instead of iterating through each temperature within each input range (which would lead to a time complexity of O(n * max range size)), the difference array allows us to update the entire range with only two operations (increment and decrement).
*   **Prefix Sum:** Prefix sums are used twice: first to convert the difference array into the frequency of each temperature and second to quickly answer the range queries.
*   **Range Queries using Prefix Sums:** By pre-calculating the prefix sum of the counts of "good" temperatures, each query can be answered in O(1) time using `prefix[right + 1] - prefix[left]`.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   Range updates with the difference array: O(n) where n is the number of input ranges.
    *   Calculating the prefix sum twice: O(MAX), where MAX is the maximum possible temperature (200001).
    *   Processing each query: O(1)
    *   Total: O(n + MAX + q), since n, q <= 2e5 and MAX = 2e5+1 , we can simplify it to O(n + q + MAX).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(MAX), due to the `update` and `prefix` vectors.

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:** This optimization disables synchronization between the C and C++ standard input/output streams and prevents the tying of `cin` to `cout`, significantly improving the input/output performance, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.
*   **`#define int long long`:** Defining `int` as `long long` prevents integer overflow issues, especially when dealing with large numbers as input.
*   **Zero-Based Indexing:** The code converts the input ranges (1-based indexing) to zero-based indexing (by decrementing l and r) to work with the vectors correctly.
*   **MAX constant:**  The `MAX` constant is carefully chosen to accommodate the maximum possible temperature values + 1 for convenience of computation of prefix sums.

## 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   The code handles the edge cases implicitly due to the problem constraint on MAX.  Since all temperatures are within the range `[0, MAX)`, out-of-bounds accesses are avoided. The algorithm is valid as long as input ranges are between 1 and 200000 (inclusive), as required by the problem.
*   The code assumes that `l` and `r` provided in the queries are valid, i.e., `0 <= l <= r < MAX`. No explicit checks are performed for these boundary conditions, but the question statement mentions that input is valid.
*   The threshold `k` is implicitly handled in the second prefix sum calculation, ensuring that only temperatures present in at least `k` ranges are counted.

## Original Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define int long long

// Problem: karenCoffee
// URL: https://codeforces.com/contest/816/problem/B
// Difficulty: hard

// Strategy:

#define MAX (200000 + 1)

int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n, k, q;
    cin >> n >> k >> q;

    vector<int> update(MAX, 0);
    int l, r;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> l >> r;
        l--, r--;
        update[l] += 1;
        update[r + 1] -= 1;
    }

    for (int index = 1; index <= MAX; index++)
        update[index] += update[index - 1];
    vector<int> prefix(MAX, 0);
    for (int index = 1; index <= MAX; index++)
        prefix[index] = prefix[index - 1] + (update[index - 1] >= k ? 1 : 0);

    while (q--) {
        cin >> l >> r;
        l--, r--;
        cout << prefix[r + 1] - prefix[l] << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
