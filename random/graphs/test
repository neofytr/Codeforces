Thank you for your response!

I had two plans depending on whether I land an SI or not. 
If I dont't get an SI, I would sit for Sem 1 PS2 and sit for placements in Sem 2 since this would improve my overall CG and chances of being placed on campus. If I do get an SI, I would try for a SI PPO itself since depending on Sem 1 placements is something I cannot afford due to my CG and branch restrictions. In the case I didn't get an SI PPO, I would try for a PS2 PPO if I didnt get placed in Sem1.

So, I would really appreciate it if
