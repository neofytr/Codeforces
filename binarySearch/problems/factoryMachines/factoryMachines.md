# Competitive Programming Solution Documentation: Factory Machines

This document analyzes a C++ solution to the "Factory Machines" problem, available on CSES (https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1620).

## 1. Problem Description

The problem states that there are *n* machines in a factory, each capable of producing products. Machine *i* takes `time[i]` seconds to produce one product. The machines can operate simultaneously. Given a target number of products *t*, the task is to find the minimum time required to produce at least *t* products.

## 2. Approach Explanation

The core idea is to use binary search to find the minimum time.  We are searching within a range of possible times. The lower bound of the search space is 0 (it is technically impossible to produce anything in 0 time, but can serve as a lower bound for binary search), and an upper bound can be `max(time) * t`, which represents the worst-case scenario where only the slowest machine is used to produce all *t* products. The binary search iteratively narrows down the time interval until the minimum time is found.

The `canMake(x, t, time)` function checks if it's possible to produce at least *t* products within a given time *x*. It iterates through the machines and calculates how many products each machine can produce in time *x* ( `x / time[i]` ). The sum of these product counts is compared with *t*.

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Binary Search:** The problem has a monotonically increasing property: if it's possible to produce *t* products in time *k*, it's also possible to produce them in time *k+1*. This allows us to apply binary search. We use a "right-biased" binary search where `right` always holds a potentially valid answer.  This is important for finding the *minimum* valid time.
*   **Monotonicity:** Identifying the monotonic property is key to efficiently solving this type of optimization problem. The monotonic property is: `canMake(x, t, time)` implies `canMake(x+1, t, time)`.
*   **`canMake` Function:** This function is critical. It efficiently determines the feasibility of a given time. Avoiding integer overflow here is also important. It checks `if (count >= t)` early to improve performance if the target is met.
*   **Integer Overflow Prevention:** Using `long long` for variables like `count` and `mid` is important, as the number of products and time values can be large, potentially leading to integer overflows during calculations.
*   **`right = (maxi)*t + 1;`:** This sets a safe upper bound for the binary search. Adding 1 ensures that the `right` variable is greater than any potentially correct answer. It also reduces the possibility of the while loop never terminating if `maxi * t` represents a correct answer.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   The `canMake` function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of machines.
    *   The binary search performs O(log( `maxi * t` )) iterations. Since `maxi` and `t` are input values, we can represent this as `O(log(M*T))`, where M is the maximum value in `time` and `T` is the total number of products to produce.
    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n * log( `maxi * t` )).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to the `time` vector. Other variables use constant space.

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **Right-Biased Binary Search:**  The `while (right != left + 1)` loop and the updates `right = mid` when `canMake(mid, t, time)` and `left = mid` otherwise implements a specific type of binary search that's designed to find the *smallest* valid value. This type of implementation is crucial when you are trying to find the smallest number that satisfies a condition.
*   **Early Exit in `canMake`:** The condition `if (count >= t)` in the `canMake` function provides an early exit if enough products have already been produced, preventing unnecessary iterations.
*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:**  This optimization disables synchronization between C++ streams and the C standard input/output streams, and unties cin from cout, which can significantly improve the input/output performance of the code.

## 6. Any Edge Cases Handled

*   **`maxi = LLONG_MIN;`**:  Initializing `maxi` to the smallest possible `long long` value handles the case where the `time` vector could contain any valid `long long` values, and ensures `maxi` correctly reflects the largest time.
*   **Zero Lower Bound:** While technically producing products in zero time is impossible, it serves as a valid lower bound for the binary search as we are searching for the *minimum* time. The actual minimal time will be greater than zero.
*   **Overflow Prevention:** The use of `long long` and the careful calculation of the upper bound prevents potential integer overflow issues, which are common in competitive programming.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <climits>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define int long long

bool canMake(int x, int t, vector<int> &time) {
    // can we make the t products in atmost x time
    int count = 0;
    for (int val : time) {
        count += (x / val);
        if (count >= t)
            return true;
    }

    return false;
}

int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n, t;
    cin >> n >> t;
    vector<int> time(n);
    int maxi = LLONG_MIN;
    for (int &val : time) {
        cin >> val;
        maxi = max(maxi, val);
    }

    // a factory has n machines which can make products
    // we have to make a total of t products
    // for machine r, it takes time[r] seconds to make a single product
    // the machines can work simultaneously and we can freely decide their schedule
    // what is the shortest time needed to make t products

    // if we can make t products in atmost k time, we can make them in atmost k + 1 time too
    int left = 0;             // this time is impossible
    int right = (maxi)*t + 1; // this won't overflow since it can at most 10^18 + 1

    while (right != left + 1) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (canMake(mid, t, time))
            right = mid;
        else
            left = mid;
    }

    cout << right << endl;
    return 0;
}
