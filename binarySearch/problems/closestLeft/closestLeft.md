# Closest Left Element (Codeforces Edu Lesson 6, Part 1, Problem B)

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of a C++ solution for the "Closest Left" problem from the Codeforces Educational Round 6, Part 1 (Binary Search) series. The specific problem URL is [https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/6/1/practice/contest/283911/problem/B](https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/6/1/practice/contest/283911/problem/B).

## 1. Problem Description

Given a sorted array `arr` of `n` integers, and `k` queries, for each query `x`, find the index of the rightmost element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `x`.  The index should be 1-based. If all elements are greater than `x`, output 0.

## 2. Approach Explanation

The problem is efficiently solved using binary search.  For each query `x`, we perform a binary search on the sorted array `arr` to find the largest index `left` such that `arr[left] <= x`.  The crucial idea is to maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, representing the range where the target element *could* be located.  `left` is initialized to -1 and `right` to `n`. This represents that we're looking for an element that could be before the start of the array or after the end of it.

The `while` loop `(right != left + 1)` continues until the `left` and `right` pointers are adjacent.  Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index `mid` and compare `arr[mid]` with `x`.

*   If `arr[mid] <= x`, we update `left` to `mid`, indicating that the target element could be to the right of `mid` (or is at `mid`).
*   If `arr[mid] > x`, we update `right` to `mid`, indicating that the target element must be to the left of `mid`.

After the binary search completes, `left` will hold the index of the rightmost element less than or equal to `x` or -1 if no such element exists. The solution then adjusts the index to be 1-based before printing the result.

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Binary Search:** The core algorithm used is binary search, taking advantage of the sorted nature of the input array.  Binary search is an efficient way to find a specific value or determine its relative position in a sorted collection.
*   **Invariant Maintenance:** The binary search implementation carefully maintains the invariant `arr[left] <= x` and `arr[right] > x`. This is critical for ensuring the correctness of the algorithm.  Specifically, `left` always points to an element that *could* be the solution (or is -1), and `right` always points to an element that is *definitely not* the solution.
*   **Initialization of `left` and `right`:** Initializing `left` to -1 and `right` to `n` is essential for handling the edge cases where all elements in the array are greater than `x` or all elements in the array are less than or equal to x.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** The binary search algorithm takes O(log n) time for each query. Since there are `k` queries, the overall time complexity is O(k log n).
*   **Space Complexity:** The code uses a vector of size `n` to store the input array. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **Integer Overflow Prevention:** The calculation of `mid` as `left + (right - left) / 2` is a standard technique to prevent integer overflow when `left` and `right` are large.
*   **1-based Indexing:** The problem requires outputting a 1-based index. The solution correctly adjusts the index by adding 1 to `left` before printing.

## 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   **Empty Array (Implicit):** Although not explicitly checked, if `n` is 0, the loop won't execute, and `left` will remain -1, leading to correct output of 0.
*   **All Elements Greater Than x:** If all elements in the array are greater than `x`, `left` will remain -1 after the binary search, resulting in the correct output of 0.
*   **All Elements Less Than or Equal to x:** If all elements are less than or equal to x, `left` will be `n-1` and the correct index `n` will be output.
*   **Single Element array:** The code correctly handles the edge cases of arrays with single elements.
