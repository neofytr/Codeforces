# Code Documentation: Codeforces Problem 492B - Vanya and Lanterns

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the C++ code solution for the Codeforces problem 492B, "Vanya and Lanterns" ([https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/492/B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/492/B)).

## 1. Problem Description

Vanya walks late at night along a straight street of length *l*, lit by *n* lanterns. The coordinate system is set such that 0 is the start of the street and *l* is the end.  The *i*-th lantern is located at position *arr[i]*. Each lantern lights all points of the street within a distance *d* from it, where *d* > 0. The problem asks to find the *minimum* value of *d* such that the entire street is lit by the lanterns.

## 2. Approach Explanation

The core idea is to use **binary search** to find the minimum required lighting distance *d*.  We perform binary search on the possible range of *d* values.

1.  **`func(double x, double l, vector<int> &arr)`**:  This function checks if a given distance *x* is sufficient to light the entire street of length *l*, given the lantern positions *arr*.  It iterates through the sorted lantern positions and maintains a `coverage` variable indicating how much of the street has been lit so far. For each lantern, it checks if there's a gap between the current coverage and the lantern's left lighting boundary (`pos - x`). If a gap exists, the function returns `false` (the current distance *x* is insufficient). Otherwise, it extends the coverage to the right boundary of the lantern's range (`pos + x`).  If at any point `coverage >= l`, it means the street is fully lit, and the function returns `true`.

2.  **Binary Search**:  The `main` function performs binary search on the range `[0, 2e9 + 1]`. The upper bound `2e9 + 1` is chosen because the street length *l* can be at most 10<sup>9</sup>.  The search range represents possible values of *d*.  In each iteration, it calculates the midpoint `mid` and calls the `func` function to check if `mid` is a valid lighting distance.

    *   If `func(mid, l, arr)` returns `true`, it means that `mid` is a large enough distance, and we can try a smaller distance. Thus, we update the `right` boundary to `mid`.
    *   If `func(mid, l, arr)` returns `false`, it means that `mid` is not a large enough distance, and we need to try a larger distance. Thus, we update the `left` boundary to `mid`.

3.  **Iteration Count**: The binary search is performed for a fixed number of iterations (50) instead of using a specific tolerance. This approach is used because of floating-point precision concerns. Running a fixed number of iterations guarantees a reasonable level of accuracy and avoids potential infinite loops due to extremely small differences. An alternative would be using a tolerance like `abs(right - left) > 1e-6`.

4.  **Output**: Finally, the `right` boundary, which represents the smallest possible distance that lights the entire street, is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Binary Search on Answer**: This is a classical technique used when looking for a minimum or maximum value that satisfies a certain condition. Here, the condition is whether a given distance *d* lights the entire street. The key is to establish a monotonic relationship: If distance *d* lights the street, then any distance greater than *d* also lights the street. This allows us to use binary search.

*   **Greedy Verification (in `func`)**: The `func` function efficiently checks if a given distance is sufficient by greedily extending the coverage of the street.

*   **Floating-Point Precision**: Binary search with floating-point numbers requires careful handling to avoid infinite loops or inaccurate results. The solution addresses this by running a fixed number of iterations (50), which often provides sufficient precision in competitive programming contexts. Alternatively, a tolerance-based termination condition could be used, such as `abs(right - left) > 1e-6`.

*   **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions is essential for the `func` function to efficiently determine the coverage of the street.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity**:
    *   Sorting the lantern positions takes O(*n* log *n*) time.
    *   The binary search runs for a fixed number of iterations (50), and each iteration calls the `func` function, which takes O(*n*) time.  Therefore, the binary search contributes O(50 * *n*) = O(*n*) time.
    *   The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, so it is **O(*n* log *n*)**.

*   **Space Complexity**:
    *   The code uses a vector `arr` of size *n* to store the lantern positions, which takes O(*n*) space.
    *   The other variables used (e.g., `left`, `right`, `mid`, `coverage`) take constant space.
    *   The overall space complexity is **O(*n*)**.

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`**: This disables synchronization between C and C++ streams and disables the tying of `cin` and `cout`, which can significantly improve the input/output performance of the code, especially for larger input sizes.
*   **`setprecision(10)`**:  This is used to set the precision of the output to 10 decimal places, ensuring that the answer is accurate enough for the problem constraints.
*   **Using fixed number of iterations in binary search**: Due to floating point precision, the binary search is run for a fixed number of steps (50 in this example).  This provides reasonable precision and avoids infinite loops.

## 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   **Empty Input**: If n=0, the code will still work fine due to the structure of the `func` function and binary search, though this case may violate the problem definition.
*   **Zero Street Length**: If l=0, the right boundary would be initialized to a value much greater than 0, and the binary search would still converge to the correct result of 0.
*   **Large Street Length**: The `right` boundary of the binary search is initialized to `2e9 + 1`, ensuring that it can handle large street lengths up to 10<sup>9</sup> as defined by the problem constraints.  This initialization is large enough to guarantee that the entire range of possible values for the minimum distance *d* is explored.
