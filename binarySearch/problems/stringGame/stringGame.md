## 1. Problem Description

The problem, sourced from [Codeforces EDU String Game](https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/6/2/practice/contest/283932/problem/F), requires determining the maximum number of characters that can be removed from a string `t` such that the remaining characters still contain the string `p` as a subsequence.

Given:

-   String `t` (the original string).
-   String `p` (the target subsequence).
-   A permutation `perm` of indices from 1 to `t.size()`.  This permutation indicates the order in which characters can be removed from `t`.

The goal is to find the largest `x` such that removing the first `x` characters specified by the `perm` array from `t` leaves `p` as a subsequence of the remaining string.

## 2. Approach Explanation

The code implements a binary search algorithm to find the optimal value of `x` (the maximum number of removable characters).

The core idea is based on the observation that if removing `x` characters allows `p` to be a subsequence of the remaining `t`, then removing any number of characters less than or equal to `x` will also allow `p` to be a subsequence.  Conversely, if removing `x` characters does *not* allow `p` to be a subsequence, then removing any number of characters greater than or equal to `x` will also not allow it.  This property makes binary search applicable.

The `can(x, t, p, perm)` function checks if it is possible to form `p` as a subsequence after removing the first `x` characters specified by the `perm` array from string `t`.

## 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

-   **Binary Search:**  The problem's monotonic nature (if we can remove `x` characters, we can remove less than `x`) makes binary search a natural and efficient choice for finding the optimal number of removals.
-   **Subsequence Checking:** The `can` function efficiently checks if `p` is a subsequence of the modified `t`.  It iterates through both strings, advancing the `pindex` only when a matching character is found in the modified `t`. The key is skipping over positions marked for removal (represented by -1).
-   **Permutation Application:** The code uses the `perm` array to selectively "remove" characters from `t` by replacing them with -1.  This avoids actually creating new strings in each step of the binary search, leading to better performance.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

-   **Time Complexity:**
    -   `can` function: O(t.size() + p.size()) in the worst case, which simplifies to O(n) where n = t.size(), assuming p.size() is at most n.
    -   Binary search: O(log n) iterations.
    -   Overall: O(n log n)

-   **Space Complexity:**
    -   `cp` (copy of `t`): O(n)
    -   `perm`: O(n)
    -   Other variables: O(1)
    -   Overall: O(n)

## 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

-   **In-place "Removal":** The code modifies the string `t` in the `can` function by replacing characters at specific indices with `-1` instead of creating a new string with characters removed. This is a standard optimization technique to reduce memory usage and improve performance.
-   **Binary Search Template:** A standard binary search template is used where `left` is a possible answer and `right` is an impossible answer. The while loop continues as long as `right != left + 1`, which means only a single value separates the left and right pointers. The answer is then `left`.
-   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`**: These lines are commonly used in competitive programming to disable synchronization between C++ streams and the standard C input/output library, and to untie `cin` from `cout`, resulting in faster input/output operations.

## 6. Edge Cases Handled

-   The code handles the case where no characters are removed (`left = 0`).
-   The code handles the case where all characters are removed (`right = t.size() + 1`). This is important because it guarantees that the binary search has a valid range.
-   The `can` function correctly handles cases where `p` is not a subsequence of the remaining `t`.

    int left = 0;             // if he doesn't delete anything, he can make the word p since it's guaranteed to be made from t
    int right = t.size() + 1; // if he deletes everything, he can't make anything

    while (right != left + 1) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (can(mid, t, p, perm))
            left = mid;
        else
            right = mid;
    }

    cout << left << endl;

    return 0;
