## Competitive Programming Solution Documentation

This document analyzes a C++ solution to a competitive programming problem, inferring the problem statement from the code and comments, explaining the solution approach, and detailing complexity and key techniques.

### 1. Problem Description (Inferred)

Given an array `arr` of `n` integers, determine if there exist non-negative integers `a` and `b` such that for all `1 <= r <= n`, the following equation holds:

`a * r + b * (n - r + 1) = arr[r]`

The input consists of `t` test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` representing the size of the array. The second line contains `n` integers representing the elements of the array `arr`.  If such `a` and `b` exist, output "Yes". Otherwise, output "No".

### 2. Approach Explanation

The solution attempts to find suitable values for `a` and `b` and then verifies if these values satisfy the given equation for all `r` from 1 to `n`. The approach can be summarized as follows:

1. **Handle `n = 1` case:** If `n` is 1, the equation becomes `a + b = arr[1]`. We can always choose `a = arr[1]` and `b = 0` which are non-negative.
2. **Solve for `a` and `b` using `r = 1` and `r = 2`:**  Two equations are formed by substituting `r = 1` and `r = 2` into the general equation:
   -  `a + n * b = arr[1]`
   -  `2a + (n - 1) * b = arr[2]`
   These equations are then solved simultaneously to express `b` in terms of the array elements and `n`.
3. **Calculate `b`:** The solution derives `b = (2 * arr[1] - arr[2]) / (n + 1)`.
4. **Check `b`:** The solution checks if `b` is an integer (i.e., the numerator is divisible by the denominator) and also if `b` is non-negative. If either of these conditions fails, the solution outputs "No".
5. **Calculate `a`:** Using the calculated value of `b`, `a` is calculated using the first equation: `a = arr[1] - n * b`.
6. **Check `a`:** The solution checks if `a` is non-negative. If not, the solution outputs "No".
7. **Verify `a` and `b` for all `r`:** Finally, the solution iterates through all `r` from 1 to `n` and verifies if the equation `a * r + b * (n - r + 1) = arr[r]` holds true. If the equation fails for any `r`, the solution outputs "No".
8. **Output "Yes":** If all checks pass, the solution outputs "Yes".

### 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

* **System of Equations:** The core insight is to recognize that the problem can be formulated as solving a system of linear equations to find the values of `a` and `b`.  The solution leverages the equations corresponding to `r = 1` and `r = 2` to derive a candidate solution for `a` and `b`.
* **Verification:** Because the derived solution for `a` and `b` might not be valid for all `r`, it is crucial to verify the solution against all other values of `r`. This verification step ensures that the solution is consistent with the entire input array.
* **Integer Arithmetic Considerations:**  The solution explicitly checks for divisibility (`num_b % denom != 0`) to ensure that `b` is an integer. This is important because the problem specifies that `a` and `b` must be integers. Also important is the use of `long long` to prevent overflow.
* **Early Exit:** The code uses an early exit strategy. If at any point during the calculations or verification, the conditions are not met (e.g., `b` is negative, `a` is negative, or the equation doesn't hold), the solution immediately outputs "No" and terminates the current test case. This avoids unnecessary computations.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:**  The time complexity is dominated by the loop that verifies the solution for all `r` from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n) per test case. Since there are `t` test cases, the overall time complexity is O(t * n).
* **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(n) due to the `arr` vector, which stores the input array.

### 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

* **`#define int long long`:** This is a common practice in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow issues, especially when dealing with larger numbers. This redefines the `int` data type to `long long`, increasing the range of representable integers. Note that using this define requires the `main` function to be defined as `int32_t main()`.
* **`ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(nullptr);`:** These lines are used to optimize input/output operations, making the program run faster.  They disable synchronization between C++ standard streams and the C standard input/output streams and untie `cin` from `cout`.
* **Early Returns for Optimization:** The code contains multiple `return` statements within the loops and conditional blocks.  These return statements allow the solution to exit early if a failure condition is detected, preventing unnecessary iterations and potentially improving the runtime.
* **Clear Variable Naming:** Using `denom`, `num_b` and `left` makes the code readable.

### 6. Edge Cases Handled

* **`n = 1`:** The code handles the case where the array contains only one element.
* **`b` is not an integer:** The code explicitly checks if `b` is an integer.
* **`a` or `b` are negative:** The code verifies that both `a` and `b` are non-negative.
* **Equation doesn't hold for all `r`:** The code verifies the solution for all values of `r`.

## Original Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long

void solve() {
    int n;
    if (!(cin >> n))
        return;
    vector<int> arr(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
        cin >> arr[i];

    if (n == 1) {
        // a + b = arr[1] -> choose a = arr[1], b = 0 (non-negative ints)
        cout << "Yes\n";
        return;
    }

    // solve from r = 1 and r = 2:
    // a + n*b = arr1
    // 2a + (n-1)*b = arr2
    // subtract: (2a+2n b) - (2a+(n-1)b) => (n+1)*b = 2*arr1 - arr2
    int denom = n + 1;
    long long num_b = 2 * arr[1] - arr[2];

    if (num_b % denom != 0) {
        cout << "No\n";
        return;
    }
    int b = num_b / denom;
    if (b < 0) {
        cout << "No\n";
        return;
    }
    int a = arr[1] - n * b;
    if (a < 0) {
        cout << "No\n";
        return;
    }

    // verify all r
    for (int r = 1; r <= n; ++r) {
        long long left = a * r + b * (n - r + 1);
        if (left != arr[r]) {
            cout << "No\n";
            return;
        }
    }
    cout << "Yes\n";
}

int32_t main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--)
        solve();
    return 0;
}

```
