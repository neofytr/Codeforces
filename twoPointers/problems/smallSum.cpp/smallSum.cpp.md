## Documentation of Competitive Programming Solution: smallSum.cpp

This document analyzes a C++ solution to the "smallSum" problem, which can be found on Codeforces (Edu Course 2, Lesson 9, Section 2, Practice: [https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/9/2/practice](https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/9/2/practice)).

### 1. Problem Description (Inferred)

Given an array of non-negative integers `arr` of size `n` and an integer `s`, find the length of the longest contiguous subarray (segment) whose sum is less than or equal to `s`. If no such subarray exists, output 0.

### 2. Approach Explanation

The solution uses a sliding window technique to efficiently find the longest "good" segment.  A "good" segment is defined as a contiguous subarray whose sum is less than or equal to `s`.  The algorithm iterates through the array using two pointers, `left` and `right`, representing the start and end of the window, respectively.

The algorithm essentially slides the window `[left, right)` across the array. For each `left` position, it expands the window to the right as much as possible while maintaining the condition that the sum of elements within the window is less than or equal to `s`.  Once the window can no longer be expanded, the length of the current "good" segment (`right - left`) is compared with the maximum length found so far (`maxi`).  The `left` pointer is then incremented, effectively sliding the window to the right, and the process is repeated.

### 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Sliding Window:** The core technique employed is the sliding window algorithm. This is highly efficient for problems involving finding subarrays or subsequences that satisfy a certain condition.
*   **Two Pointers:** The `left` and `right` pointers define the window and are used to dynamically adjust its size.
*   **Cumulative Sum (Implicit):** While a separate cumulative sum array isn't created explicitly, the `sum` variable effectively maintains the sum of the elements within the current window, allowing for efficient calculation of subarray sums.
*   **Greedy Expansion:** For each starting position (`left`), the algorithm greedily expands the window to the right until the sum exceeds the limit `s`. This ensures that the longest possible "good" segment starting at `left` is considered.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the size of the input array.  Both `left` and `right` pointers iterate through the array at most once. The inner `while` loop might seem like it increases the complexity, but since `right` is never decremented, the total number of iterations of the inner loop across all iterations of the outer loop is at most `n`.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1), as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like `left`, `right`, `maxi`, and `sum`. The input array itself is not considered part of the auxiliary space.

### 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`:** This is a standard optimization technique used in competitive programming to disable synchronization between C++ streams and the C standard input/output library, resulting in faster input and output operations.
*   **`#define int long long`:** This redefines the `int` type as `long long`. This is done to prevent integer overflow issues when dealing with potentially large sums or counts. Note that this should be done with careful consideration of the problem's constraints, because `long long` has higher memory usage and can slow down execution if regular `int` is sufficient.
*   **`maxi = LLONG_MIN;`:** Initializing `maxi` with `LLONG_MIN` is crucial to correctly find the maximum length, especially when all subarray sums exceed 's', ensuring that it will be updated if any valid segment is found.
*   **`if (right < left) right = left;`:** This ensures that if no element can be added to the window, the `right` pointer doesn't fall behind the `left` pointer, avoiding incorrect calculations in subsequent iterations. Also, without this line, if all numbers from `left` to `right - 1` add up to just `s`, when `left` increases, we won't be able to enter the inner loop again.
*   **Conditional Sum Subtraction:** The line `sum -= arr[left];` is only executed if `arr[left]` has been previously added to the `sum`. This is crucial for maintaining the correct sum of the elements within the current window as the `left` pointer moves.

### 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   **Empty Good Segment:** If no "good" segment exists (i.e., the sum of all subarrays exceeds `s`), the algorithm correctly outputs 0. This is handled by initializing `maxi` to `LLONG_MIN` and only updating it if a valid segment is found. The final `if (maxi == LLONG_MIN)` check ensures that 0 is outputted in this case.
*   **All Non-Negative Integers:**  The algorithm assumes that all elements in the array are non-negative. If negative numbers were present, the sliding window approach would not work as efficiently, and a different strategy might be required.
*   **Overflow Prevention:**  Using `long long` handles potential integer overflows when calculating the sum of elements in the subarray.
*   **When left catches up with right**: the condition `if (right < left)` prevents `right` from staying stuck behind `left`, causing infinite loops.
