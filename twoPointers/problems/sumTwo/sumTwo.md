## Code Documentation: Two Sum Variant

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the provided C++ code snippet.

### 1. Problem Description

The code solves a variant of the classic "Two Sum" problem. Given an array of `n` integers and a target value `x`, the task is to find two distinct elements in the array whose sum equals `x`. The output should be the original indices (1-based) of those two elements. If no such pair exists, the output should be "IMPOSSIBLE".

**Inferred Problem Statement:**

Given an array `arr` of `n` integers and a target value `x`, find two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1-based) such that `arr[i-1] + arr[j-1] == x`.

### 2. Approach Explanation

The code employs a two-pointer approach after sorting the array.  Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1.  **Input:** Read the number of elements `n` and the target sum `x` from standard input.
2.  **Array Initialization:** Create a vector `arr` of `n` pairs. Each pair stores the array element and its original index (1-based). This is crucial to preserve the original index information after sorting.
3.  **Input Reading:** Read the array elements from standard input and store them along with their indices in the `arr` vector.
4.  **Sorting:** Sort the `arr` vector based on the array elements. This enables the efficient two-pointer approach.
5.  **Two-Pointer Iteration:** Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, pointing to the beginning and end of the sorted array, respectively. Iterate as long as `left < right`.
    *   **Calculate Sum:** Compute the sum of the elements pointed to by `left` and `right`.
    *   **Comparison:**
        *   If the sum is less than `x`, increment `left` to consider a larger element.
        *   If the sum is greater than `x`, decrement `right` to consider a smaller element.
        *   If the sum is equal to `x`, output the original indices stored in the `second` element of the pairs at `arr[left]` and `arr[right]` and terminate the program.
6.  **No Solution:** If the loop completes without finding a solution (i.e., `left` and `right` cross each other), output "IMPOSSIBLE".

### 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Two Pointers:** The core algorithm is the two-pointer technique, which is very effective for searching pairs in a sorted array. It has linear time complexity `O(n)`.
*   **Sorting:** Sorting the array is crucial for the two-pointer approach to work efficiently. The sorting allows us to systematically search for the target sum by adjusting the pointers based on whether the current sum is too small or too large.
*   **Preserving Original Indices:** The problem requires returning the original indices of the elements that sum up to the target. The code addresses this by storing the original index along with each element in a pair. This index is preserved even after sorting.
*   **Using `pair` for element and index:** Using `pair<int, int>` is an excellent way to keep track of an element and its index together which makes the code concise.
*   **Early Termination:** The code uses `return EXIT_SUCCESS;` to terminate immediately after finding a solution, which improves efficiency.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   Sorting: `O(n log n)`
    *   Two-Pointer Iteration: `O(n)`
    *   Overall: `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.
*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   `arr` vector: `O(n)`
    *   Other variables: `O(1)`
    *   Overall: `O(n)`

### 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   `ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(nullptr);`: This is a standard optimization technique used in competitive programming to speed up input/output by disabling synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams.
*   `#define int long long`: This redefines `int` as `long long`. This is common in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow issues, especially when dealing with large numbers.
*   Using `std::pair` to store the value and original index of each number.

### 6. Any Edge Cases Handled

*   **No Solution:** The code explicitly handles the case where no two elements sum up to the target value by outputting "IMPOSSIBLE".
*   **Distinct Elements:** The two-pointer approach combined with sorting implicitly ensures that the two elements found are distinct (unless the array contains duplicate values and that is the intended solution).  Since the problem statement asks to find two *distinct* indices, the left and right pointers will never point to the same original index because `left < right` always.  The code does not handle duplicate indices specifically (it assumes that the indices have to be different, which is implied by the question).
*   **Input Size:** The code assumes a valid input size. Error handling for extremely large `n` values might be necessary in certain problem constraints, although is not explicitly handled here.

## Original Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define int long long

int32_t main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int n, x;
    cin >> n >> x;

    vector<pair<int, int>> arr(n);
    for (int index = 0; index < n; index++) {
        cin >> arr[index].first;
        arr[index].second = index + 1;
    }

    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    int left = 0;
    int right = n - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = arr[left].first + arr[right].first;
        if (sum < x)
            left++;
        else if (sum > x)
            right--;
        else {
            cout << arr[left].second << " " << arr[right].second << endl;
            return EXIT_SUCCESS;
        }
    }

    cout << "IMPOSSIBLE\n";
    return 0;
}
