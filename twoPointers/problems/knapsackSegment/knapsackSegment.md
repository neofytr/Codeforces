## Documentation for Knapsack Segment Problem

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the provided C++ code, which solves the "Knapsack Segment" problem on Codeforces (https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/9/3/practice/contest/307094/problem/E).

### 1. Problem Description

The problem asks to find a contiguous subsegment within an array of `n` items. Each item has a weight `wts[i]` and a cost `cost[i]`. The goal is to find the subsegment with a total weight not exceeding a given capacity `s` that maximizes the total cost.  If no such subsegment exists, return 0.

### 2. Approach Explanation

The code utilizes a **sliding window** technique to efficiently solve the problem.  For each possible ending index `right` of a subsegment, it maintains a window `[left, right]` that satisfies the weight constraint (total weight <= `s`).  The window is expanded by including the item at `right`. If the total weight exceeds `s`, the window is shrunk from the left by incrementing `left` until the weight constraint is met again. The maximum cost encountered across all valid subsegments is then tracked.

The core idea is based on the observation that if a subsegment `[left, right]` has a total weight exceeding `s`, then any subsegment `[left', right]` where `left' < left` will also have a total weight exceeding `s` (since weights are presumably non-negative, though not explicitly stated as a constraint. Absence of negative weights is assumed for the algorithm to hold).

### 3. Key Insights and Algorithmic Techniques Used

*   **Sliding Window:** This is the primary algorithmic technique. It allows us to efficiently explore all possible subsegments by maintaining a window and dynamically adjusting its boundaries. The window represents a potential solution that's iteratively updated.
*   **Monotonicity:** The problem exploits a form of monotonicity related to the subsegments.  As the ending index `right` increases, the valid starting index `left` (for which the segment `[left, right]` satisfies the weight constraint) is non-decreasing. This enables us to avoid re-evaluating segments that are guaranteed to exceed the weight limit.
*   **Greedy Optimization:** The window shrinking process can be viewed as a greedy approach. When the weight constraint is violated, we greedily remove items from the left end of the segment until the constraint is satisfied. This ensures that we are always considering the longest possible segment ending at `right` that satisfies the weight constraint.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of items. The `right` pointer iterates through the array once. The `left` pointer can also only increment at most `n` times.  Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1), excluding the input arrays.  The code uses a fixed number of variables (e.g., `ans`, `w`, `c`, `left`, `right`) regardless of the input size. The input arrays `wts` and `cost` take O(n) space, but this is considered input space.  The auxiliary space is O(1).

### 5. Important Code Patterns or Tricks Used

*   **`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`**: This is a common optimization technique in competitive programming to disable synchronization between C++ streams and the standard C streams, which can significantly improve input/output performance.
*   **`#define int long long`**: This redefines the `int` data type to `long long`, which prevents integer overflow issues, especially when dealing with large sums of weights and costs. This is a common practice in problems where the input constraints are large enough to cause overflows with the default `int` size.
*   **Handling Edge Cases:** Initializing `ans` to `LLONG_MIN` and checking if it remains unchanged after the loop effectively handles the case where no valid subsegment is found (i.e., every segment has a weight exceeding `s`). In that case, the code sets `ans` to 0, as requested by the problem.

### 6. Edge Cases Handled

*   **Empty Solution:** If no subsegment satisfies the weight constraint (i.e., even a single item has a weight greater than `s`), the algorithm correctly returns 0. This is handled by initializing `ans` to the smallest possible long long value and then checking at the end if it remained unchanged.
*   **Large Weights and Costs:** Using `long long` for integer variables handles the potential for large weights and costs that might cause integer overflows if using standard `int`.
*   **Zero Weights:** While not explicitly stated as allowed, the algorithm works correctly if some weights are 0. A subsegment with zero weights will always be valid as long as the overall capacity is non-negative.

In summary, the code presents an efficient and correct solution to the Knapsack Segment problem using the sliding window technique. It utilizes common competitive programming optimizations and carefully handles potential edge cases to ensure robustness.

## Original Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define int long long

// Problem: knapsackSegment
// URL: https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/9/3/practice/contest/307094/problem/E
// Difficulty: hard

// Strategy:

int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n, s;
    cin >> n >> s;

    vector<int> wts(n);
    for (int &val : wts)
        cin >> val;
    vector<int> cost(n);
    for (int &val : cost)
        cin >> val;

    // we are given an array of n items, for each them it's weight is wts[r] and cost is cost[r]
    // we need to select a segment of this array, the total weight on which is not more than s, and the
    // total cost is maximum

    // there is subsegment monotonicity in this
    // for each r,
    // we can find tmin; tmax = r
    // since all the costs are positive, the take the segment [tmin, tmax] as the segment ending at r
    // with total weight <= s with the maximum cost among all those ending at r with total weight <= s

    int ans = LLONG_MIN;
    int w = 0;
    int c = 0;
    int left = 0;
    for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
        w += wts[right];
        c += cost[right];
        while (left <= right && w > s) {
            c -= cost[left];
            w -= wts[left++];
        }
        if (left <= right) {
            // we now have [tmin, tmax = r]
            ans = max(ans, c);
        }
    }
    if (ans == LLONG_MIN)
        ans = 0;
    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
